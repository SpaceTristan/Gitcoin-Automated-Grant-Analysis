7627,"BURAK YETER X SPACE  $100,000 isn't much to go to space",10,0x0,"
The concept of Space is called One Day in Space, it's about Burak Yeter Space's live concert from 55,000ft. and a day in Space. Our goal is to play our music live for 2 hours from there.

The launch will start from Barcelona, ​​Spain. It will take 2 hours to arrive at the destination by balloons. After crossing the stratosphere, the capsule will remain stationary for performance at 55,000 ft for 2 hours. After the performance, the capsule will return to its launch starting point in Barcelona, ​​Spain.

In order to spread this project all over the world, we want to follow a big promotional campaign in the world markets in the press, TV and radio and social media.

Digital platforms where the live set can be watched live ; 
Clubbing TV, We Rave You, DJ Mag, Billboard, 1001 Tracklist, T-Mobile, Disney Plus or/and Netflix, Youtube TV, NPR Music, Power TV, Last FM.

It will be the first ever live music broadcast from outside the world. There will be 360-degree cameras all over the capsule, and people will have 360-degree viewing options for the show. The launch is planned within 6 months and it will be the first live music event from the Space.
This special event will be able to act as a metaverse and an nft collection can be made, and the whole world will recognize our community with a music feast, and this will be our call from earth to space.

We’re looking forward to the partnership on a long term with . On other hand, We will connect with our marketing team. Once we have completed the deal, we would be happy to keep a long term partnership with brand.

7647,Web3 Women in Science,7,0x06278201278C831bEd4E3d38907d6352AbdA9750,"The mission of Web3 Women in Science (W3WS) is to address the critical underrepresentation of women and nonbinary individuals at the intersection of science and web3, sometimes referred to as “DeSci” for Decentralized Science. To our knowledge, W3WS is the only existing advocacy group specifically devoted to diversity, equity, and inclusion (DEI) in the DeSci space.

TLDR: Web3 Women in Science aims to onboard and support women in science as they navigate web3. Since January 2022, we have developed communication and networking hubs and facilitated numerous speaking opportunities without funding. We now seek funding to launch a compensated contributor program and evolve into an incorporated non-profit. 

In January 2022, W3WS initially began as a series of Twitter Spaces devoted to amplifying the voices of women in DeSci. Inspired by this movement, a Telegram group was soon created to facilitate networking, and today this group has 161 members. As the needs of the community became more complex, plans for a full-fledged organization with branches for recruiting and onboarding, training and advising, and support and advocacy began to emerge. In June, a Discord server was launched with a structure in place to facilitate introductions and networking, aggregate DeSci community events, and provide access to liaisons from partner DeSci organizations to help newer contributors find their best fit in the DeSci ecosystem. 

We currently have 97 verified Discord members (75 female, 20 male, 2 nonbinary), 49% of whom have completed onboarding by posting responses to our self-introduction questionnaire. Our server hosts liaisons from five partner DeSci organizations and counting: DeSci World, Vibe Bio, NeuraDAO, talentDAO, and AthenaDAO. We are also partnering with the women-led professional growth community xCollective to gather and analyze web3 compensation data in order to promote salary transparency and aid contributors with negotiations. Finally, in addition to our own Twitter Spaces, we have been called upon to organize panels at virtual conferences, including ResearchHub’s SciCon 2022 and the upcoming Academic Web3 Conference, significantly expanding the limited opportunities for women in DeSci to access high-profile speaker slots.

W3WS is now ready for its next evolution. To date, all initiatives have been 100% powered by a small team of volunteers, and unavoidable expenses (e.g. web hosting) have been covered by the founders. As we scale up and take on more numerous and ambitious projects, a different organizational structure is required. We are here requesting funds to: (1) launch a compensated contributor program and (2) to cover the consulting costs and fees required to formalize our organization as a legally recognized non-profit. The groundwork has already been laid for immediately actionable applications of the contributor program in content creation and research. Several writers, editors, and illustrators in the community have self-assembled with the skills and passion to produce a blog highlighting women’s journeys in DeSci. Our researchers are also poised to gather elusive data on the demographics of the DeSci landscape and develop data-driven plans to improve diversity. By recruiting, onboarding, and supporting women, we shift DeSci demographics towards a more diverse, equitable, and inclusive future, which is also bound to be a more sustainable and successful future.

Thank you,

7335,The Science Commons Initiative,6,0x01D8AEff110a65DA4052f140C19af10374E44525,"Returning Science to the Public
 
The Science Commons Initiative is a non-profit collaboration aimed at increasing the public's access to and participation in the scientific process. We find, spotlight, and fund technological and other strategic infrastructure to help scientists and researchers solve some of the world's most pressing problems, with an emphasis on engaging the public. We seek to make long-lasting changes to the way science is produced and communicated so that it is more open, more democratic, and more optimized to benefit the public.

 Current Actions, Supported Projects, and Expected Use of Donations
 
The SCI currently supports development behind two user-complete projects and their communities while also supporting the advancement of the DeSci ecosystem at large. 
 
DeSci Ecosystem
The DeSci movement is using novel technology to build tools for the scientific system. These tools will remove inefficiencies, redefine incentives, and reimagine what access means. Beyond all that, The SCI believes that the DeSci movement and the tools it is building are critical for rebuilding the bridge of trust between science and the public.
 
We believe strongly that a connected DeSci is a stronger DeSci. We hope to continue building a project-agnostic, permissionless, and free infrastructure on which the DeSci ecosystem can rely for support. In addition to our currently supported DeSci initiatives, with your help we hope to grow to support events and freelance development in the DeSci space while developing avenues of outreach and education for people new to web3, DeSci, and who want to use DeSci to get involved with the scientific system.
 
DeSci Weekly Roundups
Our Weekly DeSci Roundups connect DeSci projects and their communities to one another. 
 
DeSci Community Resources Repo
We have launched and continue to develop a project-agnostic GitHub repo of DeSci resources. Projects, publications, and other resources can be added through issues, pull requests, or discussions on our Discord server. Conversations on potential additions or edits take place in public on the repo. We hope to build out repo maintenance infrastructure to include people not associated with The SCI.
 
Discord Notification Aggregation and Curation Service
Our Discord server offers a curated announcements channel. We join all the DeSci Discord servers we find, create a listening channel for their announcements, and curate high priority, critical announcements into our announcements channel. The DeSci community is welcome to leave notifications for that channel on and be confident that they will not have their wedding interrupted for an announcement about a community call. This way the community can stay up to date on the general development of the entire DeSci ecosystem without having to be involved or socially invested in every project.
 
Bounty Board
We intend to incorporate DeSci bounties on our bounty board.
 
We look forward to supporting DeSci initiatives such as conferences and funding rounds as we further establish ourselves as a viable non-profit in the DeSci ecosystem.

The Berkeley Open Infrastructure for Networked Computing (BOINC)
BOINC is the first highly successful permissionless distributed computing platform. It was developed out of SETI@Home in 1999. In many ways, it is the embodiment of DeSci.
 
To date, BOINC has been the driving force behind numerous computationally intensive research programs; There have been over 400 scientific papers published using results from BOINC projects. Some notable achievements include producing an accurate 3D model of SARS-CoV-2 before crystallization-based models (Rosetta@home), developing a manufactured and distributed COVID-19 vaccine (Rosetta@home), finding new subatomic particles (LHC@Home), identifying pulsars (Einstein@Home), advancements in cancer marker and treatment research (World Community Grid), simulation of candidate molecules for next-generation solar panels (World Community Grid), advancements in climate research (ClimatePrediction.Net), along with many, many others.
 
BOINC ties the public to science, in part, by enabling any individual to create a distributed computing project for the cost of a server, which can be as simple as a personal laptop running in their garage. The public chooses to engage with the project, learn about the science, and participate. While BOINC is used by countless science enthusiasts, many of the large projects are supported by institutions such as universities from around the world, CERN, Krembil Research Institute, and the Max Planck Institute.
 
BOINC Radio Podcast
The BOINC Radio has been hosting a BOINC oriented podcast for over two years! The discussions range from the greater implications of distributed computing, to BOINC specific architecture, to development hopes and dreams, to informal chats about various beverages. A weekly beacon for the community, the BOINC radio gives anyone who wants a place to share their BOINC story, and there doesn’t seem to be any end in sight.
 
The Project briefs
The Project briefs are a spinoff from the BOINC Radio Podcast. They are detailed, yet palatable, explanations of BOINC projects, their science, and how to contribute. With over two dozen episodes recorded so far, the Project briefs will undoubtedly need new projects to spin up to keep going! Or maybe they can dig into the hundreds of projects from BOINC’s past…
 
Bounty Board
The SCI currently hosts bounties for the BOINC community and development team.
 
The SCI hopes to further accelerate BOINC development and adoption by funding bounties, helping new distributed computing projects spin up their servers and connect their applications, and spreading education on the platform to institutions and enthusiasts far and wide.

Gridcoin
Developed during the second altcoin explosion as the first PoW bootstrapped coin to transition to PoS (2013) and the first entirely science-based blockchain and Open Economic Network, Gridcoin is an open-source multi-incentive permissionless blockchain that mints and distributes cryptocurrency to various contribution-based and point-accruing systems. It currently distributes currency according to the relative processing power a network participant directs toward data-driven analysis and scientific discovery across BOINC.
 
The SCI hopes to support the Gridcoin community in its quest to use distributed ledger technology and economics to bring science to everyone, and everyone to science. Its main incentive structure encourages researchers to educate the public as to the value and methods of their research while encouraging the public to seek out information on the research itself.
 
The SCI believes that expanding and supporting the blockchain and economic protocol behind Gridcoin will serve to establish a resilient and persistent connection between science and the public.
 
Bounty Board
The SCI currently hosts bounties for the Gridcoin community and development team.
 
The SCI hopes to further accelerate Gridcoin development and adoption by funding bounties, helping Gridcoin incorporate new point-accruing systems into its incentive layer, and, among other things, by providing a vehicle for formal representation throughout the DLT industry.

Expected Use of Donations
The SCI has established a bounty board and intends to use a portion of the donations from GR15 to develop it to include bounties for all currently supported projects. Donations will also be directed toward community growth initiatives for all currently supported projects. Additionally and if possible, donations will be used to increase the number of projects The SCI supports. There are already a few projects we have our eyes on and we would love to develop the infrastructure to support them through bounties and community initiatives. Finally, donations will be used to cover general expenses incurred by operating a 501c3, such as web hosting, legal fees, accounting, etc. No board members or officers in The SCI receive pay for their work.

7536,Truust: A proposed new computational model as an approach to hyper-computing,5,0x5cc1096143944a4AF961f70a9e1b89f509a3d236,"TL;DR
What is this project?
How the brain is able to achieve hyper-computation, whereas traditional Turing machine based computers can not, is of critical importance to all of humanity and more specifically to all of science & engineering. This project's aim is to test the existence of a physical phenomena hypothesized to form the basis for hyper-computation in the brain. This physical phenomena is only possible if a universe exists testable by a proposed computing device whose model is beyond the Turing based paradigm. The proposed architecture is informed in part by prior work which found evidence from novel neuro-imaging techniques that led to a brief research period at CERN. 

What will the funding for this project provide?
The funding for this project will provide for labor & materials to test a so far unexplored interpretation of reality, which if successful will enable efforts to develop a new computational model beyond Turing machine based architecture to scale. The labor component will comprise 6 fte optical scientists & algorithms engineers to work together for a period of 2-3 years developing a prototype computing device using the materials. The materials component will comprise optical & electronic equipment. 
The experimental validation will be to test whether or not the computing device can mine a block of bitcoin faster than otherwise possible. 

Why is this project the right thing to focus on?
This is the right thing to focus on because as Adam Becker highlights in his book 'What is Real?' a foundational question key to progress in Physics has been overlooked. All of humanity's conflict is attributed to how best to source, process and distribute resources. We don't believe such conflict is solve-able via organizational behavior. Only a breakthrough in devising a computational model beyond Turing which can elicit subsequent technological progress such that a paretotopian goal aligned outcome is possible can stave off likely catastrophe to come from resource conflicts on Earth. The proposed project to develop & test a proposed computational model beyond Turing is directly related to the foundational question Becker refers to. If successful, the experimental validation will provide for an indisputable marker that the device has reached supremacy and that the universe works in a retrocausal manner. If unsuccessful, the experimental result will provide for scientific knowledge that this path is not the way forward. 

If this project is successful, Cui bono?
There is a large and growing library of algorithms for applications of breakthrough innovation like self-driving cars, AGI, CAD that exist but which cannot run because hardware capable of running them does not exist. The data volume and complexity of these workloads is beyond what is possible to today's GPU's and all forms of advanced Turing based compute. What is needed is a new computational model. If this project is successful, scientists and engineers who have developed such algorithms, and users of their resultant applications, would benefit. As well, scientific researchers working downstream from fundamental Physics would benefit, as if this model of computation works, it would say something specific about the foundational question in Physics referenced in Becker's book. 

How does this project fit with DeSci?
This project fits within DeSci as all progress in science & engineering depends on a breakthrough at this level, without which desired applications elsewhere will not be possible as today's Turing machine based computers can't process information fast enough to deliver the desired applications. Further this project is unlikely to be funded elsewhere given systemic issues with how capital is allocated in scientific research. As well, all known other research efforts in this domain are failing. 
 
MOTIVATION
It's a little known reality that current forms of computing are limited in terms of ability to compute fast enough to solve problem types critical for continued technological progress. This issue is beyond what most people think of in respect to so-called Moore's Law. This issue is referred to technically as the Turing barrier and attempts to develop new computational models to move beyond Turing is a research domain technically known as hyper-computing.
 
IMPACT
This area of research has high impact because all technological progress depends on a breakthrough in this research domain. Without which, all of science & engineering, not to mention the global economy, will be limited in terms of the types of applications which can be brought to bear. Thus the outcome trajectory of delivering such a breakthrough is either leveling up our species' place on the Kardashev scale or being faced with a evolutionary dark age with corresponding catastrophe to accompany such an outcome. When you evaluate where capital flows in this research domain, controlled for the theoretical perspective of the physics that needs to hold for these systems to work, you become alarmed to find that all capital is only going towards two of the potentially three ways to construct these systems.
 
GOAL
Our proposal is based on an original discovery regarding how the brain achieves hyper-computation. This discovery led to a brief research period at CERN and we subscribe that the only way the observed phenomenon could be real is if a specific so far unexplored interpretation of physics is the way forward. We propose developing a new computing device whose successful computation would only be possible if this were true. The technical term for what we propose is known as counterfactual hyper-computing.
 
HISTORY & OTHER DETAILS
Reaching the Turing barrier means no more technological progress, no matter the computational power available, which has known adverse outcomes in terms of economy and society, the effort to develop a new computational model beyond Turing is known as hyper-computing.
These are classes of problems where even a universe sized computer, one composed of all the matter in the universe, that ran for the length of the universe, wouldn't compute fast enough (i.e. self-driving cars, AGI, classic traveling salesman problem, designing systems for more efficient space travel/energy/medical applications, etc.).
In an effort to uncover inspiration for a new computational model, the PI developed software (30s video: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rhRwpAA1KeA) which reconstructs a previously unseen pathway in neural communication validated by a reputable neural lab (https://thedaily.case.edu/discovering-a-new-form-of-communication-in-the-brain/).
Using the software the PI was able to demonstrate that the electromagnetic field in neural tissue accesses quantum effects to perform hypercomputation (via analysis of recordings of resected rat cortical neuron slices under a pharmacologically induced sleep / wake model > synaptic pruning during slow wave sleep is known to be beyond what Turing computers can achieve).
This work led to a brief time at CERN, given from the known critiques against quantum effects persisting in the brain (e.g. Tegmark re temperature & time), with an aim towards reviewing what interpretation would need to hold, for the prior observations to be real.
Within hyper-computing efforts, when you evaluate where capital is allocated, controlled for the physics that needs to hold for those systems to work, you become alarmed that all the capital is only going to two of the three potential interpretations, which are proving to be difficult to scale (https://www.ft.com/content/6d2e34ab-f9fd-4041-8a96-91802bab7765).
The PI proposes developing a counterfactual hyper-computer, whose computation would only work in a universe where the third so-far unexplored interpretation would be real, namely paradox-free retrocausality.
The experimental test proposed is to see if computational supremacy can be demonstrated via bitcoin mining, given within computational complexity it's known the type of computer proposed would have unrivaled speedup.
If this device becomes real the larger opportunity is to help broad applications in scientific engineering by enabling systems of linear equations at a level of complexity & data scale beyond what is possible with today's GPU's to be solve-able.
The proposal involves a 2-3 year research project with 6 fte including the PI and includes a forecasted budget requirement of $5mm in US fiat.
The implication, if this project is successful, would mean that quantum mechanics would be an emergent property of space-time, not unlike how it's been shown recently that electromagnetism is (https://sciencex.com/news/2021-07-electromagnetism-property-spacetime.html), which itself suggests that what the PI proposes is physically possible and achievable to engineer at a human scale (and within reason to suspect that the electromagnetic field in brains manipulate space-time), where otherwise it was thought that large masses would be needed to effect gravity at a level required in order to manipulate space-time.
Recently Sir Roger Penrose has been public regarding his view that retroactivity is what imbues the brain with its computational abilities (40:59 to 55:05: https://youtu.be/L_o-86wYDp8?t=2459) which is consistent with the suggestion that the electromagnetic field in brain's manipulate space-time.
Sir Roger Penrose has been public that whatever the secret to brain function is likely to be found in the ephaptic connections (3:43:48 to 3:48:00: https://youtu.be/L_o-86wYDp8?t=2459) which the referenced software reconstructed and was the source for the PI finding evidence for quantum effects persisting in the brain (suggesting the physical phenomenon sought in this experiment is the key to how brain's achieve hypercomputation).
The proposed physical phenomena was first predicted by Gödel in some of his solutions to Einstein's equations, which has been discarded by the science community, although it is found in Penrose's Conformal Cyclic Cosmology.
The proposed device would incorporate two parts that together would combine to elicit counterfactual computation:
optical loop ring resonator using lasers & mirrors to elicit falaco soliton across time (2:05 to 2:10 in this video: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pnbJEg9r1o8).
recursive brute force algorithm (8min video: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zCnz4GxNd_M).
Here is a presentation for the proposed project (with corresponding additional links): https://www.beautiful.ai/player/-NB9TV4QniFKmUfuzyxR
Here is a 60 min talk the PI gave in 2019 reviewing his research path to arrive at the proposal: https://drive.google.com/file/d/1kJ4Achi2DZmVa2hZsaYbraakeAP6ZGSP/view
It must be noted that the general science community is likely to find this proposal laughable, however to our mind we argue that it is not absurd to investigate an equally absurd possibility (in regards to the foundational implications of a working hyper-computer).
The gitcoin opportunity has potential for high impact given it's unlikely for this project to receive funding otherwise given systemic issues with how capital is allocated in scientific research
On the scale of humanity, one would assume given the importance of moving beyond Turing, that we would leave no stone unturned.

6895,DeKnow ID - Web3 Native LinkedIn for Scholars and Science,4,0x0,"What is DeKnow ID
In short term, DeKnow ID = decentralized Google Scholar + DBLP, data fully in user’s control.
We will transform any scholar’s academic life as data on chain, secured, privacy protected, under people’s full control.

Problems Statement
As a student, professor, scholar, scientist…
I don’t have a way to show my academic reputation to the academic community and future employers.
I don’t have a way to be recommended with great prospective students

DeKnow Solution Proposal
DeKnow will first create a permissionless, non-custodial web3 identity for scholars and science. With the success of which, we will help community build an collboration web3 ecosystem powered by DAO, connecting scholars, students, enterprise in research activities and day to day life.

DeKnow ID
We will have two parts to the project: On-Chain Smart Contracts as interface and protocol to hold Scholar and Paper, and webapp to serve as scholar personal portal.

Bootstrapping Seeding Profiles and Papers
Public records will be retained via Google Scholar and Microsoft Academic Graph to construct initial scholar profile and paper citation references. Going forward, users will be incentivized to add more and more accurate references in DeKnow ID platform directly.

Collect Real Person Resume
Resumes are the most accurate and update to date for academic students and scholars, much more than industrial. The project will focus on having scholar to submit resume to mint scholar profile NFT.

A.I. for matching Student - Professor
With accurate information, DeKnow ID platform can match and recommend students and professors accurately.

On-Chain Smart Contracts
Both Scholar and Paper will start as current NFT ERC721. Both are transferable with specific considerations for Papers.
Scholar NFT will hold relationships with papers, relationships with other scholars, scholar reputations.

Paper NFT will create a new protocol for co-owned NFT, hopefully later contribute back to Ethereum foundation community. With research paper nature, a paper will be co-owned by co-authors, contributions distributed, decisions to be made by having full or partial consensus betwen co-authors. It functions as a “mini-DAO” on the paper level.

Off-Chain Webapp as scholar3.me
The webapp serve as a personal portal for scholar to show, view, manager owned Scholar NFT and Paper NFT.

DeKnow Ecosystem
Coming after DeKnow ID is in place

Milestone #1: Pilot: DeKnow ID Webapp and NFT
Delieverables
- Chrome Extension to capture google scholar url
- Backend services to parse and capture google scholar information
- DeKnow ID webapp on testnet, enabling user to upload CV, mint NFT
- DeKnow Scholar NFT and Paper NFT are live on testnet

7603,Pode Crer: Tech education for marginalized youth,4,0x6Dbd02e2CD85A443318ebEd00aeeDB0fd09ee86e,"This grant will fund scholarships of $45/mo (200 brazilian reais per month) to support 200 Brazilian youth from marginalized communities studying in the Pode Crer project of technology education. Pode Crer is already running until December 2022. Pode Crer is free, but many of the students come from very poor families and face a dilemma between studying and working to help their families - $45 is extremely impactful and helps keep students in the program until completion. 



What is the Pode Crer program?

Pode Crer (name after a portuguese expression that literally translates to ""one can believe"" but on daily use means something like ""right on!"") is a new technology and leadership education program tailored to bring youth from Brazilian marginalized communities into the knowledge economy. It is conceived and executed by the Vilson Groh Institute, an organization with a 40-year history of grassroots work focused in education, creating opportunity, promoting inclusion in the challenging social context of Brazilian marginalized communities. Today the Vilson Groh Institute supports a network of 8 educational and social organizations that reaches 6000 students and supports 20000 people.

Pode Crer is the synthesis of these 40 years of experience into a scalable educational methodology. Pode Crer has an innovative integrative educational approach that blends technology, citizenship, communication and leadership skills. 

In 2021 the program ran with 320 participants, and in 2022 with 300 participants across three educational tracks for ages 11-14, 14-18 and 18+. Over the next years the Vilson Groh Institute envisions building five Social Innovation Centers across marginalized communities in the greater Florianópolis region. These will serve as hubs for consolidation and expansion of the Pode Crer program, and as laboratories for incubation of social projects and experimentation.

Pode Crer 2021 Impact 

320 students participated in the 2021 iteration of Pode Crer. Of 200 students aged 14+, over 66 got job opportunities, 37 of them in technology, and 7 students were admitted to public universities. In marginalized communities this kind of impact is life changing - many participants never used a computer before. These are youth whose default career path would be to join drug trafficking, or at best low paying unskilled jobs. We are in talks with a Brazilian researcher from J-PAL (Abdul Latif Jameel Poverty Action Lab) interested in doing rigorous impact evaluation and writing an academic study that will inform public policy in Brazil and the world. 

If excess funds are raised, they will be directed for the 2023 implementation of Pode Crer, which is budgeted  at USD 250k (BRL 1.2M) but currently faces funding uncertainty due to the elections in Brazil. If more than USD 250k are raised, the excess funds will be directed towards the construction of the first social innovation center, which is budgeted at USD 1.2M (BRL 6M). If even more is raised, we will continue building social innovation centers, we already have the location for the first 5 selected.

The Pode Crer Vision 

We want to break the cycle of urban misery, violence and deliberate exclusion in Brazil through Pode Crer, an innovative complementary education targeting vulnerable youth, and to provide an example that can be replicated across the country and other developing nations. Pode Crer is conceived and executed by the Vilson Groh Institute, a Brazilian nonprofit with a 40-year history that coordinates and supports a network of eight schools, educational centers and social organizations in the Greater Florianópolis region that reaches 6000 students and impacts over 20000 people. The institute’s focus is on social justice and uplifting marginalized communities in Brazil through education.

Pode Crer is a new complementary education program and methodology created to shape the future of Brazilian education and society. It aims to prepare students to be engaged leaders in society and active participants in the knowledge economy. Pode Crer implements a new educational approach and curriculum that blends technology, citizenship and communication. It is underpinned by the development of leadership skills in students, tested in the challenging social context of Brazilian marginalized communities, where the program is implemented. 

Pode Crer currently takes place in the city of Florianópolis, in the south of Brazil. Is divided into three educational tracks for ages 11-13, 14-17 and 18-24. The pilot program took place in 2021 with 320 young people in a hybrid format. In May 2022, its second iteration began, in a fully face-to-face format, with 300 young people, some of whom participated in 2021. Pode Crer is free and open for all.

The long-term vision of Pode Crer is to provide complementary education from birth to university age. To enable this vision and to serve as hubs for the implementation and growth of Pode Crer, five Social Innovation Centers will be created across the greater Florianópolis region in locations close to partner organizations. These centers will have state-of-the-art infrastructure to offer all the educational tracks of Pode Crer continuously. The first center is planned to open by 2023 in the community of Monte Serrat in Florianópolis, where Vilson Groh lives, and to completely reinvent the community's image. It will feature a maker space, computer labs, classrooms and workshops, auditorium, library, co-working spaces and social spaces.


About the Vilson Groh Institute
Pode Crer is conceived and executed by the Vilson Groh Institute,  a Brazilian nonprofit that  coordinates and supports a network of eight schools, educational centers and social organizations in the Greater Florianópolis region. The institute’s focus is on social justice and uplifting marginalized communities in Brazil through education.

The Institute and its partner organizations have a long history of success creating new educational programs serving marginalized communities and vulnerable populations in the most challenging situations in Brazil, in the midst of urban misery and violence. Because of this long experience and its institutional management capacity, the Vilson Groh Institute and its partner organizations are in a unique position to create, operationalize, and refine bold new educational initiatives for Brazil. 

This network of organizations was built over 40 years of work by Vilson Groh and many other engaged individuals in marginalized and impoverished communities. At the age of 22 Vilson moved to the community of Monte Serrat in Florianópolis and never left. Now 68 years old and going strong, Vilson Groh’s vision and passion have blossomed into a network coordinating about 400 volunteers from all social classes. Their primary focus is on education and creating opportunities for young people in vulnerable situations.

Summary of impact the past 10 years
In addition to Pode Crer, the Vilson Groh Institute operates several other social programs that are primarily focused on youth, education, culture, community support, and family support. They reach deep into very violent communities and over years have radically changed and improved the lives of many people heavily involved with drug trafficking, violence, dysfunctional families, and lack of social and economic opportunities

== An average of 4800 people took part in the institute’s programs each year
== Over 7M meals offered
== About $110 mean monthly investment per children in school programs
== 1500 children current enrolled in full time education across partner organizations
== 1000 children currently enrolled in part time education across partner organizations
== 2200 families supported per year
== An average of 300 volunteers each year
== 225 university scholarships were provided
== 450 people admitted to university after preparation courses
== 2100 youth got their first job after training

The big picture problem
We want to break the cycle of urban misery, violence and deliberate exclusion in Brazil through an innovative complementary education targeting vulnerable youth, and to provide an example that can be replicated across the country and serve as an example for other nations. 


Global urban misery, violence, subhuman living conditions and extreme inequality was caused by growing population coupled with fast and disorganized urbanization in the developing world over the past 100 years: The fraction of global urban population went from 15% to 60%, and global population went from 1.9B to 7.8B people. 


Brazil is one of the most unequal countries in the world, and one of the most extreme cases of rapid and completely disorganized urbanization: total population went from 30M to 212M, and urban population from 15% to 85%, with 40 times more people living in cities today than 100 years ago. 


The thorny problem of urban misery interwoven with violence and extreme inequality is most emblematically represented by the images of the favelas of Rio de Janeiro amid the backdrop of luxury condos, but the dynamic is consistently repeated across every major city in Brazil.

We have a scalable program,Pode Crer, now in its second pilot year, that achieves this by equipping youth with technical and socio-emotional skills to participate in the knowledge economy, and we have the capacity to scale it: across 8 organizations in our network we have over 40 years of experience and dozens of educational programs that reach over 6000 students and impact 20,000 people in communities across the greater Florianópolis region in Brazil. 

Creating an inclusive knowledge economy and a society of leaders
The Pode Crer program and methodology aims at nothing less than reinventing basic education in Brazil, and consequently the future of the country's human development. The strategy is to begin this transformation through complementary education, where it is possible to innovate, iterate and be bold.

Pode Crer operates in the opposite period to the public school system (in Brazil classes happen in mornings or afternoons only) and is therefore free from many of the shackles of the education system. Pode Crer develops fundamental elements that are absent in the public education system and aims to become such a shining example of success that other educational organizations will copy it, and eventually shape the public education system itself. 

While Pode Crer is currently implemented in three educational tracks for students aged 11 to 24 years old, the long term vision is to continuously guide students from one track to another, and to be expanded to offer complementary training from kindergarten to university. 

The curriculum has three foundations: technology, citizenship, and communication. They were designed to prepare the student to actively participate in the knowledge economy, which demands skills that are not part of the Brazilian education system. 

Beyond just technical skills, the fundamental element important is the ability to work well with people. Developing autonomy, communication and teamwork for working in a creative and dynamic environment demands emotional intelligence, awareness and self-confidence. These are elements that form the foundation of leadership, explicitly developed and improved by CEOs and executives, but typically ignored in other contexts. Creating an inclusive knowledge economy that is not insular and elitist requires developing these elements in all individuals as part of the educational system. This means creating a society of leaders.

The full development of a knowledge economy also requires a society with functioning institutions and high levels of interpersonal trust. In Brazil these elements are still fraught and often absent. The country has institutions that are an important foundation but are still young and fragile. It is necessary to change Brazil's pervasive culture of corruption. This culture manifests itself through a generalized mindset of trying to get ahead of others, usually by skirting the rules or disregarding what is public and common. It is necessary to inculcate civic mindedness into every Brazilian, and a genuine regard for everything that is common, shared and public. 

When implemented on a national scale, Pode Crer will be paving the way in Brazil for the creation of a society of leaders with an inclusive knowledge economy - something that still does not truly exist anywhere in the world. The creation of an inclusive knowledge economy is the only sustainable way of closing the great social gaps in Brazil. In an economy where everyone actually participates, it is not necessary to permanently resort to assistance programs or income redistribution. 

Current plans: Creating 5 Social Innovation Centers
The plan for the growth of Pode Crer in the near future is the creation of multiple Social Innovation Centers throughout the greater Florianópolis region, in communities where the Vilson Groh Institute operates. These centers will be structures built close to partner educational organizations that have already implemented or will implement Pode Crer educational tracks.   

The first center will be built in the community of Monte Serrat.. It will be built on land given over for 30 years, alongside a partner school. It will have an amphitheater for events, an interactive library, a coworking space, a music studio, a maker space, classrooms and computer labs. Its construction is budgeted at 6 million reais (1.2M USD). About 20% of the resources for its construction are already secured. 

After Monte Serrat neighborhood the next two centers will be built in the Monte Cristo neighborhood in Florianópolis and at Ponte do Imaruim in Palhoça. The first is home to CEDEP (https://cedeponline.com.br), a popular and experimental education center that has 30 years of experience with complementary education. CEDEP carries out innovative educational experiments with vulnerable youth based on the philosophy of Brazilian educator Paulo Freire. The second location is home to the AJPII elementary school (https://ajp2.org.br/), where the Pode Crer track 1 pilot takes place (11 -13 years). 



Location and proposed design of the first social innovation center in the community of Monte Serrtat in Florianópolis, Brazil. 



If you were given $500M what would you do? 

With $500M we would have a 25x more ambitious 10-year plan: Instead of 5, we would create 125 social innovation centers in marginalized communities (favelas) across Brazil. These centers will be hubs for Pode Crer, our new complementary education program created to prepare vulnerable and marginalized youth for the knowledge economy. Pode Crer launched in 2021 and currently serves 300 students across two communities aged 11-24, being free and open to all. 

Pode Crer is a new educational approach tailored to Brazilian reality that blends civics, technology and leadership, equipping youth with technical and socio-emotional skills to participate in the knowledge economy. It is based on over 40 years of experience working with marginalized communities across 8 educational organizations reaching 6000 students. 

Because Pode Crer is a complementary education program (running in the opposite shift to schools) it is free of constraints of the Brazilian school system. We can innovate and iterate rapidly. 

The first center will open in 2023. Each center costs $1M to build and $500k per year to operate in full. A center can serve 600 Pode Crer students and reaches about 5000 community members. Each center is planned to be staffed by 12 educators and 8 support staff. 

We have the institutional capacity to operate and grow Pode Crer. We are bottlenecked by fundraising. We are confident that if we have the money we can train and grow our team of educators by 50% each year. With $5M we could have these 5 centers built and operational by 2027. With $500M we would aim to create and operate 125 centers across Brazil by 2033. Instead of just the ​​Florianópolis region, we would like to influence educational policy and reshape education in Brazil. 

We are talking with the Stanford University “Lemann Center for Educational Entrepreneurship Innovation in Brazil” to create studies about Pode Crer. Our goal is to put out rigorous studies to guide policy and pave the way to grow across Brazil. 

The city of Medellin in Colombia has a successful “smart city” experience that informs our vision. Since the 1990s over different governments they were able to drastically reduce violence and improve life quality by re-urbanization and creating community centers in strategic locations. There are two main differences: First, our approach starts from a focus on lifelong education, while in Medellin it started from a re-urbanization plan. Second: In Medellin action started from the city government and engaged civil society, while we are starting from civil society and engaging multiple city governments. 

Crucial partners we need to engage are local governments. We have deep ties with civil society in the Florianópolis region, and we work with 3 other different city governments. We believe that cities across Brazil will be receptive to our experience. Investment in our programs can be done in tranches. If we receive $5M today in a few years we will have multiple centers operating and conclusive results to support further investment in 3-4 years. 



If Pode Crer was ultimately successful and fully implemented, how would the world be different?

 If we truly succeed, then every one of the 50 million youth in Brazil aged 18 and under will have access to lifelong complementary education shaped after the Pode Crer approach. That means education tailored to their local realities, that teaches a civic mindset, and to equip them with the technical and socio-emotional skills needed to thrive in the knowledge economy. 

We have a long term vision of lifelong education, and want to support people from birth to adult age. We are looking beyond the 10 year plan outlined for the $500M, which would reach  an estimated 75k Pode Crer students and 625k people across the 125 social innovation centers. A 25 year horizon would be more coherent with the scale of our vision.

To have such a broad impact we need to influence education policy at the city, state and national level in Brazil. We believe we can do that in two ways. First by publishing rigorous academic studies that show to policy makers the efficacy of our educational approach and enabling evidence-based policy making - we are already talking with the Lemann Center at Stanford to create such rigorous studies.  Second, by having each social innovation center serve as a reference for how to implement the program and adapt it to a new community, and as a hub for training educators and program managers. We believe that as soon as the first center is completed in 2023 this will happen, and we will be ready to assist organizations outside our network on how to implement our approach. 

If we truly achieve our vision, then we will have an integrated society, city center and urban periphery will not be segregated and stigmatized. We will have broken with the vicious cycle of obscene urban exclusion that occurs in Brazil. We will have achieved this by creating an inclusive knowledge economy in Brazil. That is to say, a society in which every individual in working age is able to participate in the knowledge economy. Currently this doesn’t exist in any country yet, because participation in the knowledge economy requires significant training that only relatively few elite workers have, making their labor extremely valuable. This inequality in training leads to significant social and economic inequality, as is becoming more evident every day across the US and in particular in Silicon Valley, where technology workers command salaries far higher than any other industry. 

In his book “​​The Knowledge Economy”, Harvard Brazilian scholar Roberto Mangabeira Unger describes the knowledge economy as insular and exclusive, and he advocates for a new kind of educational system in Brazil geared towards enfranchising people to participate in it. We believe Pode Crer is exactly that, and we are working every day to consolidate and grow the program. 

If we succeed then rather than be marginalized, every community in Brazil will be empowered  to solve their own problems, and be able to leverage modern technology. Instead of squandering youth to drug trafficking and violence with no human development, we will create a society of leaders with a civic mindset and an understanding of the powerful technologies they have at their disposal to improve the world. This will start with local communities, but it will grow: these empowered leaders will become more and more active participants in society, from companies to civic organizations to local, state and national governments. That kind of civic engagement is what Brazil needs and what we wish to foster through lifelong education with a long term vision. 

We expect that our experience will serve as a template for other countries. The world would be different because through education and opportunity, underprivileged communities would be the protagonist of their rise from misery and poverty. Not big companies, not governments, but individuals themselves will have the sense of agency, the confidence, and the skills to do so. 



What bottlenecks is keeping us from quickly scaling Pode Crer?

Immediate funding needs: USD 250k to guarantee operations for 2023
Because of the election year, there is very high uncertainty that we will be able to secure funds from CAIXA, the federal bank that funded Pode Crer in 2021 and 2022 with 1M BRL ($200k).

Going beyond the minimum: scalable growth with social innovation centers


Pode Crer was designed for scalable growth, with plans to create 5 social innovation centers to serve as hubs of the program in communities where the Vilson Groh Institute already operates. Each center is designed to serve up to 1000 Pode Crer students and reach 20.000 people.

A center costs $1.2M to build and $300k/year to operate in full with 12 staff, and features a maker space, computer labs, classrooms and workshops, auditorium, library, co-working spaces and social spaces.  To make things happen faster, the strategy is to raise private money to build the first centers quickly while securing government support for ongoing operational costs. If money is secured the first center can be made operational in 2023.



Operating Budget - currently $250k/year for 300 youth
The 2022 implementation is supported by a team of 21 people, including educators, social workers, pedagogues and administrators. The budget for 2022 is R$1.2M (250k USD). Today Pode Crer is implemented as two weekly meetings in the morning or in the afternoon, in classes of up to 25 students who have classes and workshops on two topics a day. 

The primary bottleneck for immediately scaling Pode Crer is money, the 2022 budget is $250k and the program runs two days a week with 300 students total. Because we are only able to hire the educators as part-time staff, we could readily double the capacity of the program if we had twice the money ($500k) and reach 600 students total.

In the current two-day-a-week format, a team of 4 educators working full-time could serve 400 students on each educational track. To offer the program 5 days a week to 400 students, a team of 8 educators would be required. Currently, the two biggest limitations for the Program are financial resources to hire the entire team as full-time staff (many can only be paid part time), and physical space for the program's activities. It is possible to double the reach of the program with the current team and twice the financial resources, with an yearly operating budget of R$2.4M (about 500k USD).

Student support scholarships ($40/mo)

Another challenge that we face is keeping students in class and getting some families to not pressure students to leave class to seek work, which is common with the vulnerable students from marginalized communities. Students on tracks 2 and 3 receive an allowance of R$200 (USD 40) per month during the program. This allowance is fundamental to incentivize them and their families to focus on studies rather than procuring work to supplement family income. 


Physical space and locations
The secondary bottleneck is location and physical space, getting to the classroom is challenging for many students, even with financial support for transport that we offer. Currently, Pode Crer is implemented in two locations due to the availability of spaces in two partner organizations and 3 educational tracks for ages 11-13 (track 1), 14-17 (track 2) and 18-24 (track 3). Tracks 2 and 3 are implemented in the city of Florianópolis and track 1 in the city of Palhoça. They serve very different communities and audiences, with different cultures. This creates a challenge for the consolidation of Pode Crer, as it is necessary to ensure coherence in the implementation of the program at each pole. But it also creates a huge opportunity for the developed methodology to be extremely robust. If all trails can be successfully implemented in two locations with distinct communities and cultures, this suggests that the implementation will be robust in new locations and cultures. 

To address the space and transport issues we want to build the first social innovation center in the heart of the community of Monte Serrat in Florianópolis where we have worked for many decades. It will provide high quality teaching spaces, technology labs, a library, makerspace, co-working space and socialization areas. As we expand the program we want to learn from this center to improve the design and implementation of the next ones. With more space and resources it will be possible to offer optional activities on the other 3 days of the week. Immediate possibilities that we would like to implement are focused workshops on technology, sports, culture, and to develop communication and leadership skills in smaller groups. 

Team growth
Finally, in order to truly scale, we will face the challenge of training and developing our team of educators. Currently we have hundreds of educators and staff in the organizations, and the 2022 implementation of Pode Crer supported by a team of 21 people, educators, social workers, pedagogues and administrators. We are very confident that we have the capacity to grow the team of educators by 50% each year, which would be sufficient to realize the vision of 125 centers with 12 educators and 8 support staff in each by 2033. We have the capacity to select good people, and train them in our educational approach, and to make them effective educators in the challenging contexts of Brazilian marginalized communities. What we need are a modicum of resources to make this vision happen even faster. If we receive $5M today in a few years we will have multiple centers operating and conclusive results to support further investment in 3-4 years.

The story of Vilson Groh
---------------------------------------------
Vilson Groh is a Catholic priest who in 1979 moved to the marginalized community of Monte Serrat in Florianópolis and devoted his life to enfranchising marginalized communities, using lifelong education and advocacy to bridge pervasive urban exclusion. This work continues today: now 68, living in the same place in Monte Serrat and still going strong, Vilson continues to use the respect, goodwill and convening power he earned over a lifetime of work dedicated to others to advance social justice through education and community.


Vilson was born and raised in Brusque, a city founded by German immigrants in 1860 in the state of Santa Catarina. He came to Florianópolis in 1978 to pursue graduate studies at the Federal University of Santa Catarina (UFSC). Soon after Vilson moved to the marginalized community of Monte Serrat in Florianópolis, which back then had no running water, sewage, paved roads, electricity or any kind of service. It was the quintessential favela, a Brazilian shantytown growing uphill without any kind of government oversight or regard, with rampant crime, violence and drug trafficking
 Vilson devoted his life to enfranchising marginalized communities, using lifelong education and advocacy to bridge pervasive urban exclusion, and this work continues today. For decades Vilson lived like the poorest, in a wooden hut, like most people around him. For that to change it took his mother demanding that he live with a modicum of dignity when many around him had brick and mortar houses, she refused to visit him for a year. He finally upscaled into a humble two bedroom brick and mortar house built by the community in that spot, where Vilson continues to live today. 
Every day Vilson uses the respect, goodwill and convening power he earned over a lifetime of work dedicated to others to advance social justice through education, community and helping literally everyone in need.


---------------------------------------------
The Vilson Groh Network
---------------------------------------------

Through Vilson Groh’s leadership and that of many others, small projects have flourished and became reference organizations in communities. As time went on other organizations joined the movement, and the Vilson Groh Institute was founded in 2011, to strengthen the actions of these organizations already under the leadership of Vilson Groh.
It should be highlighted that all of this work is performed in violent and marginalized communities in an extremely challenging educational context: students are initially violent, aloof, brute, emotionally undeveloped, and often going hungry. This network approach only works because every educator, volunteer and supporter is sensible and deeply aware of the realities in each community, and the Institute is extremely good at training educators. The network works through a holistic approach and engage with everyone involved: students, parents, families and the community, meeting social reality, constantly reassessing it and adjusting our approach.
Today the organizations that compose the Vilson Groh Network are:
== CEDEP (Center for Popular Education) - an experimental community educational organization created from scratch based on Paulo Freire’s philosophy complementary education for 600 youth and continuing education for adults
== AJPII (John Paul II association) - a school for children an and adolescent education where track 1 of Pode Crer is executed
== MESLM (Marist School Lucia Mayvorne) - free full time education for about 500 children and adolescents
== MESSJ (Marist School São José) - free full time education for about 1000 children and adolescents
== CCEA (Slave Anastácia Cultural Center) - cultural activities, support for children and youth, and tracks 2 and 3 of the Pode Crer program
== ACAM (Mocotó Hill Children Friends Association) - youth education and shelter for children and adolescents in vulnerable families
== AGB (Friends of Guinea-Bissau) - runs bilateral education programs for elementary and high school, as well as teacher trainings in Guinea-Bissau
== IVG (The Vilson Groh Institute itself) - runs university preparation program, the Pode Crer program, multiple family and community support programs

Personal statement

Personal Statement from Eduardo da Veiga Beltrame - https://munfred.com - eduardo@redeivg.org.br
I have been a very strong supporter of Pode Crer from the start, being in close contact with the Vilson Groh Institute leadership, and with over $120k donations of my own money (most of my wealth). I donated most of my would-be salary, money from a house sale in Brazil, and gave them computers, equipment, 3D printers and robotics kits. In 2022 I did a 5 week deep dive across all organizations of the Vilson Groh Institute, I talked to all the teachers, students, staff, community members, and spent a lot of time with the leaders of each organization. I also gave several 3D printing workshops to teachers and students, to make sure I understood day to day reality. 

I believe Pode Crer offers a template for the future of education in Brazil and Latin America. I am extremely confident in their exceptional institutional management and in their ability to operationalize programs and train and grow teams of educators. The Vilson Groh Institute is the right institution to spearhead this change, to iterate and refine such an ambitious program, and to work with cities and governments to implement what works as public policy.","Valid Ethereum Address. https://vilsongroh.org connection successful. https://redeivg.org.br/podecrer connection successful. https://www.brazilfoundation.org/podecrerfund/ connection successful. https://www.redeivg.org.br/doe-agora/ connection successful. https://munfred.com) unable to be reached. https://redeivg.org.br) unable to be reached. https://www.redeivg.org.br/relatorios-sociais/ connection successful. https://cedeponline.com.br), unable to be reached. https://ajp2.org.br/), unable to be reached. https://munfred.com connection successful.

6985,Faceless,4,0x693F321C9861047505F4a922931569f5Af2cc6f2,"The payment scheme of the existing blockchain networks such as Ethereum is based on blockchain addresses, which are usually random strings that are hard to memorize and manage. Therefore, it might lead to many inconveniences for the users such as funds being transferred to the wrong address. In contrast, traditional payment is usually based on human-readable identifiers (HRI) instead of random strings, and this is for a good reason. For instance, when you pay your debts to your friends, you want the transaction record to be bound to your identity so that it can serve as proof later that your debt has been paid. 

The existing HRI solutions such as ENS usually focus on one specific blockchain ecosystem and fails to incorporate many existing Web 2.0 human-readable identifiers that users are more comfortable using in practice, such as their mobile phone numbers, various social media accounts, email addresses (based on which PayPal systems are built), etc. We believe it is far more interesting to build a cross-platform payment scheme based on a generic HRI system that combines the users' existing Web 2.0 and Web 3.0 identifiers. A cross-platform payment scheme based on a generic HRI system will not only serve the purpose of bringing Web 2.0 users into the Web 3.0 world but also taps into this immense market and helps realize the full potential of Web 3.0.

Another limit of existing HRI-based payment solutions is the lack of privacy. This is actually closely tied to another interesting application of Faceless protocol, i.e., regulatory-compliant payment. Due to the explosive growth of Web 3.0 payment and its applications such as DeFi, NFT, etc, traditional financial institution is starting to migrate to Web 3.0. However, in order for the Cryptocurrency market to attract institutional money on a large scale, one has to address its regulatory concerns. The privacy issue is likely to play a central part in the regulatory compliance requirements. Faceless will provide a private payment scheme based on HRI and hence resolve the privacy issue. 

Our protocol will become a fierce competitor in the sphere of regulatory-compliant payment. In the Web 3.0 world, the HRIs will serve as the basis of regulatory-compliant finance. Faceless satisfies two vital requirements of regulatory compliance: 1. HRI will serve as the basis of regulatory compliance, 2. Our payment solution will be private, which addresses a central issue in any regulatory-compliance requirement. One's HRIs such as mobile numbers or social media accounts can serve as the foundation to implement various regulation-compliant operations such as anti-money laundering. More sophisticated applications such as trusted decentralized finance (DeFi) can also be built on top of our system. For instance, one could build a credit system or lending and borrowing system based on one's HRIs.

Our scheme is based on a combination of identity-based encryption (IBE) and zero-knowledge proof. Identity-based encryption scheme will allow the users to encrypt the payment under the receiver’s identity instead of random blockchain addresses, and it will also allow the users to manage their multiple HRIs with one single master key, which is a significant usability advantage. Our architecture will introduce a mechanism, which is based on randomized signature, to verify the authenticity of the user identity while protecting the users’ privacy. The verifiable identity will therefore serve as a foundation of regulatory-compliant payment. On the other hand, we will apply the zero-knowledge proof and IBE scheme to protect the users’ financial privacy. We will provide an open-source library to demonstrate the feasibility of our concrete design. 

The final product of Faceless protocol will be a layer-2 protocol, which can be deployed on smart contract platforms such as Ethereum. We will potentially introduce a zk-rollup scheme to further improve the scalability of our payment scheme. Our rollup scheme will mainly focus on resolving the conflict between the scalability issue and regulatory compliance requirements.

Newsmartjob: Every freelancer’s go-to website! 

We, Divine pandas are a team of the app and web experts whose only goal is to improve client productivity and business strength by providing affordable and effective marketing solutions. Founder Divya Jyoti Sen and co-founder Jade Lai-ting li started a team of 22 web experts with over 12 years of experience that can provide the best website design, development, and marketing services to grow their client’s business online. Recently we have launched a new platform called Newsmartjob to provide opportunities and freelancing gigs to job seekers in the blockchain industry. Ours is the only blockchain smart contract freelance platform to ever exist. 

Smart contracts are digital contracts that work on certain terms and conditions to make sure whether an agreement is automatically executed or not. Official contracts like these are necessary to satisfy the freelancers and the clients that their payment and task will be completed satisfactorily.As a freelancer, it’s very important to have trust and transparency with your clients. Because that is the foundation of any successful business. There are numerous platforms out there that help freelancers get good gigs and consistent work. But when it comes to payment, their process is either too slow or clients back out at the last moment.Whatever the reason, freelancers have to suffer in the end. They are overworked and denied their reward, whether intentionally or unintentionally. But this doesn’t happen with Newsmartjob because we use smart contracts like MetaMask to avoid any kind of payment delay. Interestingly, we are the only ones to have this system as of now. MetaMask is a kind of smart contract or a cryptocurrency wallet that singlehandedly works on both desktop and mobile devices. It is popular because of its ability to buy, send and receive cryptocurrency from within the wallet. Smart contracts provide this level of security and safety among job seekers to maintain their trust. With the presence of these digital contracts, it becomes easier for freelancers to provide great value to their clients without any second thoughts. Newsmartjob accepts everyone around the globe to be a part of their platform and earn a consistent income through it. With emerging advanced technologies like these, people can trust freelancing as a legit carrier choice. 

Just like other jobs, freelancing has its pros and cons but one of its biggest drawbacks was denied payment. Nobody likes losing their hard-earned money. Newsmartjobs understands this pain and agony and their smart contracts act as a painkiller for the same.

7603,Pode Crer: Tech education for marginalized youth,4,0x6Dbd02e2CD85A443318ebEd00aeeDB0fd09ee86e,"This grant will fund scholarships of $45/mo (200 brazilian reais per month) to support 200 Brazilian youth from marginalized communities studying in the Pode Crer project of technology education. Pode Crer is already running until December 2022. Pode Crer is free, but many of the students come from very poor families and face a dilemma between studying and working to help their families - $45 is extremely impactful and helps keep students in the program until completion. 



What is the Pode Crer program?

Pode Crer (name after a portuguese expression that literally translates to ""one can believe"" but on daily use means something like ""right on!"") is a new technology and leadership education program tailored to bring youth from Brazilian marginalized communities into the knowledge economy. It is conceived and executed by the Vilson Groh Institute, an organization with a 40-year history of grassroots work focused in education, creating opportunity, promoting inclusion in the challenging social context of Brazilian marginalized communities. Today the Vilson Groh Institute supports a network of 8 educational and social organizations that reaches 6000 students and supports 20000 people.

Pode Crer is the synthesis of these 40 years of experience into a scalable educational methodology. Pode Crer has an innovative integrative educational approach that blends technology, citizenship, communication and leadership skills. 

In 2021 the program ran with 320 participants, and in 2022 with 300 participants across three educational tracks for ages 11-14, 14-18 and 18+. Over the next years the Vilson Groh Institute envisions building five Social Innovation Centers across marginalized communities in the greater Florianópolis region. These will serve as hubs for consolidation and expansion of the Pode Crer program, and as laboratories for incubation of social projects and experimentation.

Pode Crer 2021 Impact 

320 students participated in the 2021 iteration of Pode Crer. Of 200 students aged 14+, over 66 got job opportunities, 37 of them in technology, and 7 students were admitted to public universities. In marginalized communities this kind of impact is life changing - many participants never used a computer before. These are youth whose default career path would be to join drug trafficking, or at best low paying unskilled jobs. We are in talks with a Brazilian researcher from J-PAL (Abdul Latif Jameel Poverty Action Lab) interested in doing rigorous impact evaluation and writing an academic study that will inform public policy in Brazil and the world. 

If excess funds are raised, they will be directed for the 2023 implementation of Pode Crer, which is budgeted  at USD 250k (BRL 1.2M) but currently faces funding uncertainty due to the elections in Brazil. If more than USD 250k are raised, the excess funds will be directed towards the construction of the first social innovation center, which is budgeted at USD 1.2M (BRL 6M). If even more is raised, we will continue building social innovation centers, we already have the location for the first 5 selected.

The Pode Crer Vision 

We want to break the cycle of urban misery, violence and deliberate exclusion in Brazil through Pode Crer, an innovative complementary education targeting vulnerable youth, and to provide an example that can be replicated across the country and other developing nations. Pode Crer is conceived and executed by the Vilson Groh Institute, a Brazilian nonprofit with a 40-year history that coordinates and supports a network of eight schools, educational centers and social organizations in the Greater Florianópolis region that reaches 6000 students and impacts over 20000 people. The institute’s focus is on social justice and uplifting marginalized communities in Brazil through education.

Pode Crer is a new complementary education program and methodology created to shape the future of Brazilian education and society. It aims to prepare students to be engaged leaders in society and active participants in the knowledge economy. Pode Crer implements a new educational approach and curriculum that blends technology, citizenship and communication. It is underpinned by the development of leadership skills in students, tested in the challenging social context of Brazilian marginalized communities, where the program is implemented. 

Pode Crer currently takes place in the city of Florianópolis, in the south of Brazil. Is divided into three educational tracks for ages 11-13, 14-17 and 18-24. The pilot program took place in 2021 with 320 young people in a hybrid format. In May 2022, its second iteration began, in a fully face-to-face format, with 300 young people, some of whom participated in 2021. Pode Crer is free and open for all.

The long-term vision of Pode Crer is to provide complementary education from birth to university age. To enable this vision and to serve as hubs for the implementation and growth of Pode Crer, five Social Innovation Centers will be created across the greater Florianópolis region in locations close to partner organizations. These centers will have state-of-the-art infrastructure to offer all the educational tracks of Pode Crer continuously. The first center is planned to open by 2023 in the community of Monte Serrat in Florianópolis, where Vilson Groh lives, and to completely reinvent the community's image. It will feature a maker space, computer labs, classrooms and workshops, auditorium, library, co-working spaces and social spaces.


About the Vilson Groh Institute
Pode Crer is conceived and executed by the Vilson Groh Institute,  a Brazilian nonprofit that  coordinates and supports a network of eight schools, educational centers and social organizations in the Greater Florianópolis region. The institute’s focus is on social justice and uplifting marginalized communities in Brazil through education.

The Institute and its partner organizations have a long history of success creating new educational programs serving marginalized communities and vulnerable populations in the most challenging situations in Brazil, in the midst of urban misery and violence. Because of this long experience and its institutional management capacity, the Vilson Groh Institute and its partner organizations are in a unique position to create, operationalize, and refine bold new educational initiatives for Brazil. 

This network of organizations was built over 40 years of work by Vilson Groh and many other engaged individuals in marginalized and impoverished communities. At the age of 22 Vilson moved to the community of Monte Serrat in Florianópolis and never left. Now 68 years old and going strong, Vilson Groh’s vision and passion have blossomed into a network coordinating about 400 volunteers from all social classes. Their primary focus is on education and creating opportunities for young people in vulnerable situations.

The big picture problem
We want to break the cycle of urban misery, violence and deliberate exclusion in Brazil through an innovative complementary education targeting vulnerable youth, and to provide an example that can be replicated across the country and serve as an example for other nations. 


Global urban misery, violence, subhuman living conditions and extreme inequality was caused by growing population coupled with fast and disorganized urbanization in the developing world over the past 100 years: The fraction of global urban population went from 15% to 60%, and global population went from 1.9B to 7.8B people. 


Brazil is one of the most unequal countries in the world, and one of the most extreme cases of rapid and completely disorganized urbanization: total population went from 30M to 212M, and urban population from 15% to 85%, with 40 times more people living in cities today than 100 years ago. 


The thorny problem of urban misery interwoven with violence and extreme inequality is most emblematically represented by the images of the favelas of Rio de Janeiro amid the backdrop of luxury condos, but the dynamic is consistently repeated across every major city in Brazil.

We have a scalable program,Pode Crer, now in its second pilot year, that achieves this by equipping youth with technical and socio-emotional skills to participate in the knowledge economy, and we have the capacity to scale it: across 8 organizations in our network we have over 40 years of experience and dozens of educational programs that reach over 6000 students and impact 20,000 people in communities across the greater Florianópolis region in Brazil. 

Creating an inclusive knowledge economy and a society of leaders
The Pode Crer program and methodology aims at nothing less than reinventing basic education in Brazil, and consequently the future of the country's human development. The strategy is to begin this transformation through complementary education, where it is possible to innovate, iterate and be bold.

Pode Crer operates in the opposite period to the public school system (in Brazil classes happen in mornings or afternoons only) and is therefore free from many of the shackles of the education system. Pode Crer develops fundamental elements that are absent in the public education system and aims to become such a shining example of success that other educational organizations will copy it, and eventually shape the public education system itself. 

While Pode Crer is currently implemented in three educational tracks for students aged 11 to 24 years old, the long term vision is to continuously guide students from one track to another, and to be expanded to offer complementary training from kindergarten to university. 

The curriculum has three foundations: technology, citizenship, and communication. They were designed to prepare the student to actively participate in the knowledge economy, which demands skills that are not part of the Brazilian education system. 

Beyond just technical skills, the fundamental element important is the ability to work well with people. Developing autonomy, communication and teamwork for working in a creative and dynamic environment demands emotional intelligence, awareness and self-confidence. These are elements that form the foundation of leadership, explicitly developed and improved by CEOs and executives, but typically ignored in other contexts. Creating an inclusive knowledge economy that is not insular and elitist requires developing these elements in all individuals as part of the educational system. This means creating a society of leaders.

The full development of a knowledge economy also requires a society with functioning institutions and high levels of interpersonal trust. In Brazil these elements are still fraught and often absent. The country has institutions that are an important foundation but are still young and fragile. It is necessary to change Brazil's pervasive culture of corruption. This culture manifests itself through a generalized mindset of trying to get ahead of others, usually by skirting the rules or disregarding what is public and common. It is necessary to inculcate civic mindedness into every Brazilian, and a genuine regard for everything that is common, shared and public. 

When implemented on a national scale, Pode Crer will be paving the way in Brazil for the creation of a society of leaders with an inclusive knowledge economy - something that still does not truly exist anywhere in the world. The creation of an inclusive knowledge economy is the only sustainable way of closing the great social gaps in Brazil. In an economy where everyone actually participates, it is not necessary to permanently resort to assistance programs or income redistribution. 

Current plans: Creating 5 Social Innovation Centers
The plan for the growth of Pode Crer in the near future is the creation of multiple Social Innovation Centers throughout the greater Florianópolis region, in communities where the Vilson Groh Institute operates. These centers will be structures built close to partner educational organizations that have already implemented or will implement Pode Crer educational tracks.   

The first center will be built in the community of Monte Serrat.. It will be built on land given over for 30 years, alongside a partner school. It will have an amphitheater for events, an interactive library, a coworking space, a music studio, a maker space, classrooms and computer labs. Its construction is budgeted at 6 million reais (1.2M USD). About 20% of the resources for its construction are already secured. 

After Monte Serrat neighborhood the next two centers will be built in the Monte Cristo neighborhood in Florianópolis and at Ponte do Imaruim in Palhoça. The first is home to CEDEP (https://cedeponline.com.br), a popular and experimental education center that has 30 years of experience with complementary education. CEDEP carries out innovative educational experiments with vulnerable youth based on the philosophy of Brazilian educator Paulo Freire. The second location is home to the AJPII elementary school (https://ajp2.org.br/), where the Pode Crer track 1 pilot takes place (11 -13 years). 



Location and proposed design of the first social innovation center in the community of Monte Serrtat in Florianópolis, Brazil. 



If you were given $500M what would you do? 

With $500M we would have a 25x more ambitious 10-year plan: Instead of 5, we would create 125 social innovation centers in marginalized communities (favelas) across Brazil. These centers will be hubs for Pode Crer, our new complementary education program created to prepare vulnerable and marginalized youth for the knowledge economy. Pode Crer launched in 2021 and currently serves 300 students across two communities aged 11-24, being free and open to all. 

Pode Crer is a new educational approach tailored to Brazilian reality that blends civics, technology and leadership, equipping youth with technical and socio-emotional skills to participate in the knowledge economy. It is based on over 40 years of experience working with marginalized communities across 8 educational organizations reaching 6000 students. 

Because Pode Crer is a complementary education program (running in the opposite shift to schools) it is free of constraints of the Brazilian school system. We can innovate and iterate rapidly. 

The first center will open in 2023. Each center costs $1M to build and $500k per year to operate in full. A center can serve 600 Pode Crer students and reaches about 5000 community members. Each center is planned to be staffed by 12 educators and 8 support staff. 

We have the institutional capacity to operate and grow Pode Crer. We are bottlenecked by fundraising. We are confident that if we have the money we can train and grow our team of educators by 50% each year. With $5M we could have these 5 centers built and operational by 2027. With $500M we would aim to create and operate 125 centers across Brazil by 2033. Instead of just the ​​Florianópolis region, we would like to influence educational policy and reshape education in Brazil. 

We are talking with the Stanford University “Lemann Center for Educational Entrepreneurship Innovation in Brazil” to create studies about Pode Crer. Our goal is to put out rigorous studies to guide policy and pave the way to grow across Brazil. 

The city of Medellin in Colombia has a successful “smart city” experience that informs our vision. Since the 1990s over different governments they were able to drastically reduce violence and improve life quality by re-urbanization and creating community centers in strategic locations. There are two main differences: First, our approach starts from a focus on lifelong education, while in Medellin it started from a re-urbanization plan. Second: In Medellin action started from the city government and engaged civil society, while we are starting from civil society and engaging multiple city governments. 

Crucial partners we need to engage are local governments. We have deep ties with civil society in the Florianópolis region, and we work with 3 other different city governments. We believe that cities across Brazil will be receptive to our experience. Investment in our programs can be done in tranches. If we receive $5M today in a few years we will have multiple centers operating and conclusive results to support further investment in 3-4 years. 



If Pode Crer was ultimately successful and fully implemented, how would the world be different?

 If we truly succeed, then every one of the 50 million youth in Brazil aged 18 and under will have access to lifelong complementary education shaped after the Pode Crer approach. That means education tailored to their local realities, that teaches a civic mindset, and to equip them with the technical and socio-emotional skills needed to thrive in the knowledge economy. 

We have a long term vision of lifelong education, and want to support people from birth to adult age. We are looking beyond the 10 year plan outlined for the $500M, which would reach  an estimated 75k Pode Crer students and 625k people across the 125 social innovation centers. A 25 year horizon would be more coherent with the scale of our vision.

To have such a broad impact we need to influence education policy at the city, state and national level in Brazil. We believe we can do that in two ways. First by publishing rigorous academic studies that show to policy makers the efficacy of our educational approach and enabling evidence-based policy making - we are already talking with the Lemann Center at Stanford to create such rigorous studies.  Second, by having each social innovation center serve as a reference for how to implement the program and adapt it to a new community, and as a hub for training educators and program managers. We believe that as soon as the first center is completed in 2023 this will happen, and we will be ready to assist organizations outside our network on how to implement our approach. 

If we truly achieve our vision, then we will have an integrated society, city center and urban periphery will not be segregated and stigmatized. We will have broken with the vicious cycle of obscene urban exclusion that occurs in Brazil. We will have achieved this by creating an inclusive knowledge economy in Brazil. That is to say, a society in which every individual in working age is able to participate in the knowledge economy. Currently this doesn’t exist in any country yet, because participation in the knowledge economy requires significant training that only relatively few elite workers have, making their labor extremely valuable. This inequality in training leads to significant social and economic inequality, as is becoming more evident every day across the US and in particular in Silicon Valley, where technology workers command salaries far higher than any other industry. 

In his book “​​The Knowledge Economy”, Harvard Brazilian scholar Roberto Mangabeira Unger describes the knowledge economy as insular and exclusive, and he advocates for a new kind of educational system in Brazil geared towards enfranchising people to participate in it. We believe Pode Crer is exactly that, and we are working every day to consolidate and grow the program. 

If we succeed then rather than be marginalized, every community in Brazil will be empowered  to solve their own problems, and be able to leverage modern technology. Instead of squandering youth to drug trafficking and violence with no human development, we will create a society of leaders with a civic mindset and an understanding of the powerful technologies they have at their disposal to improve the world. This will start with local communities, but it will grow: these empowered leaders will become more and more active participants in society, from companies to civic organizations to local, state and national governments. That kind of civic engagement is what Brazil needs and what we wish to foster through lifelong education with a long term vision. 

We expect that our experience will serve as a template for other countries. The world would be different because through education and opportunity, underprivileged communities would be the protagonist of their rise from misery and poverty. Not big companies, not governments, but individuals themselves will have the sense of agency, the confidence, and the skills to do so. 



What bottlenecks is keeping us from quickly scaling Pode Crer?

Immediate funding needs: USD 250k to guarantee operations for 2023
Because of the election year, there is very high uncertainty that we will be able to secure funds from CAIXA, the federal bank that funded Pode Crer in 2021 and 2022 with 1M BRL ($200k).

Going beyond the minimum: scalable growth with social innovation centers


Pode Crer was designed for scalable growth, with plans to create 5 social innovation centers to serve as hubs of the program in communities where the Vilson Groh Institute already operates. Each center is designed to serve up to 1000 Pode Crer students and reach 20.000 people.

A center costs $1.2M to build and $300k/year to operate in full with 12 staff, and features a maker space, computer labs, classrooms and workshops, auditorium, library, co-working spaces and social spaces.  To make things happen faster, the strategy is to raise private money to build the first centers quickly while securing government support for ongoing operational costs. If money is secured the first center can be made operational in 2023.



Operating Budget - currently $250k/year for 300 youth
The 2022 implementation is supported by a team of 21 people, including educators, social workers, pedagogues and administrators. The budget for 2022 is R$1.2M (250k USD). Today Pode Crer is implemented as two weekly meetings in the morning or in the afternoon, in classes of up to 25 students who have classes and workshops on two topics a day. 

The primary bottleneck for immediately scaling Pode Crer is money, the 2022 budget is $250k and the program runs two days a week with 300 students total. Because we are only able to hire the educators as part-time staff, we could readily double the capacity of the program if we had twice the money ($500k) and reach 600 students total.

In the current two-day-a-week format, a team of 4 educators working full-time could serve 400 students on each educational track. To offer the program 5 days a week to 400 students, a team of 8 educators would be required. Currently, the two biggest limitations for the Program are financial resources to hire the entire team as full-time staff (many can only be paid part time), and physical space for the program's activities. It is possible to double the reach of the program with the current team and twice the financial resources, with an yearly operating budget of R$2.4M (about 500k USD).

Student support scholarships ($40/mo)

Another challenge that we face is keeping students in class and getting some families to not pressure students to leave class to seek work, which is common with the vulnerable students from marginalized communities. Students on tracks 2 and 3 receive an allowance of R$200 (USD 40) per month during the program. This allowance is fundamental to incentivize them and their families to focus on studies rather than procuring work to supplement family income. 


Physical space and locations
The secondary bottleneck is location and physical space, getting to the classroom is challenging for many students, even with financial support for transport that we offer. Currently, Pode Crer is implemented in two locations due to the availability of spaces in two partner organizations and 3 educational tracks for ages 11-13 (track 1), 14-17 (track 2) and 18-24 (track 3). Tracks 2 and 3 are implemented in the city of Florianópolis and track 1 in the city of Palhoça. They serve very different communities and audiences, with different cultures. This creates a challenge for the consolidation of Pode Crer, as it is necessary to ensure coherence in the implementation of the program at each pole. But it also creates a huge opportunity for the developed methodology to be extremely robust. If all trails can be successfully implemented in two locations with distinct communities and cultures, this suggests that the implementation will be robust in new locations and cultures. 

To address the space and transport issues we want to build the first social innovation center in the heart of the community of Monte Serrat in Florianópolis where we have worked for many decades. It will provide high quality teaching spaces, technology labs, a library, makerspace, co-working space and socialization areas. As we expand the program we want to learn from this center to improve the design and implementation of the next ones. With more space and resources it will be possible to offer optional activities on the other 3 days of the week. Immediate possibilities that we would like to implement are focused workshops on technology, sports, culture, and to develop communication and leadership skills in smaller groups. 

Team growth
Finally, in order to truly scale, we will face the challenge of training and developing our team of educators. Currently we have hundreds of educators and staff in the organizations, and the 2022 implementation of Pode Crer supported by a team of 21 people, educators, social workers, pedagogues and administrators. We are very confident that we have the capacity to grow the team of educators by 50% each year, which would be sufficient to realize the vision of 125 centers with 12 educators and 8 support staff in each by 2033. We have the capacity to select good people, and train them in our educational approach, and to make them effective educators in the challenging contexts of Brazilian marginalized communities. What we need are a modicum of resources to make this vision happen even faster. If we receive $5M today in a few years we will have multiple centers operating and conclusive results to support further investment in 3-4 years.

The story of Vilson Groh
---------------------------------------------
Vilson Groh is a Catholic priest who in 1979 moved to the marginalized community of Monte Serrat in Florianópolis and devoted his life to enfranchising marginalized communities, using lifelong education and advocacy to bridge pervasive urban exclusion. This work continues today: now 68, living in the same place in Monte Serrat and still going strong, Vilson continues to use the respect, goodwill and convening power he earned over a lifetime of work dedicated to others to advance social justice through education and community.


Vilson was born and raised in Brusque, a city founded by German immigrants in 1860 in the state of Santa Catarina. He came to Florianópolis in 1978 to pursue graduate studies at the Federal University of Santa Catarina (UFSC). Soon after Vilson moved to the marginalized community of Monte Serrat in Florianópolis, which back then had no running water, sewage, paved roads, electricity or any kind of service. It was the quintessential favela, a Brazilian shantytown growing uphill without any kind of government oversight or regard, with rampant crime, violence and drug trafficking
 Vilson devoted his life to enfranchising marginalized communities, using lifelong education and advocacy to bridge pervasive urban exclusion, and this work continues today. For decades Vilson lived like the poorest, in a wooden hut, like most people around him. For that to change it took his mother demanding that he live with a modicum of dignity when many around him had brick and mortar houses, she refused to visit him for a year. He finally upscaled into a humble two bedroom brick and mortar house built by the community in that spot, where Vilson continues to live today. 
Every day Vilson uses the respect, goodwill and convening power he earned over a lifetime of work dedicated to others to advance social justice through education, community and helping literally everyone in need.

The Vilson Groh Network
---------------------------------------------

Through Vilson Groh’s leadership and that of many others, small projects have flourished and became reference organizations in communities. As time went on other organizations joined the movement, and the Vilson Groh Institute was founded in 2011, to strengthen the actions of these organizations already under the leadership of Vilson Groh.
It should be highlighted that all of this work is performed in violent and marginalized communities in an extremely challenging educational context: students are initially violent, aloof, brute, emotionally undeveloped, and often going hungry. This network approach only works because every educator, volunteer and supporter is sensible and deeply aware of the realities in each community, and the Institute is extremely good at training educators. The network works through a holistic approach and engage with everyone involved: students, parents, families and the community, meeting social reality, constantly reassessing it and adjusting our approach.
Today the organizations that compose the Vilson Groh Network are:
== CEDEP (Center for Popular Education) - an experimental community educational organization created from scratch based on Paulo Freire’s philosophy complementary education for 600 youth and continuing education for adults
== AJPII (John Paul II association) - a school for children an and adolescent education where track 1 of Pode Crer is executed
== MESLM (Marist School Lucia Mayvorne) - free full time education for about 500 children and adolescents
== MESSJ (Marist School São José) - free full time education for about 1000 children and adolescents
== CCEA (Slave Anastácia Cultural Center) - cultural activities, support for children and youth, and tracks 2 and 3 of the Pode Crer program
== ACAM (Mocotó Hill Children Friends Association) - youth education and shelter for children and adolescents in vulnerable families
== AGB (Friends of Guinea-Bissau) - runs bilateral education programs for elementary and high school, as well as teacher trainings in Guinea-Bissau
== IVG (The Vilson Groh Institute itself) - runs university preparation program, the Pode Crer program, multiple family and community support programs

Personal statement

Personal Statement from Eduardo da Veiga Beltrame - https://munfred.com - eduardo@redeivg.org.br
I have been a very strong supporter of Pode Crer from the start, being in close contact with the Vilson Groh Institute leadership, and with over $120k donations of my own money (most of my wealth). I donated most of my would-be salary, money from a house sale in Brazil, and gave them computers, equipment, 3D printers and robotics kits. In 2022 I did a 5 week deep dive across all organizations of the Vilson Groh Institute, I talked to all the teachers, students, staff, community members, and spent a lot of time with the leaders of each organization. I also gave several 3D printing workshops to teachers and students, to make sure I understood day to day reality. 

I believe Pode Crer offers a template for the future of education in Brazil and Latin America. I am extremely confident in their exceptional institutional management and in their ability to operationalize programs and train and grow teams of educators. The Vilson Groh Institute is the right institution to spearhead this change, to iterate and refine such an ambitious program, and to work with cities and governments to implement what works as public policy.","Valid Ethereum Address. https://vilsongroh.org connection successful. https://redeivg.org.br/podecrer connection successful. https://www.brazilfoundation.org/podecrerfund/ connection successful. https://www.redeivg.org.br/doe-agora/ connection successful. https://munfred.com) unable to be reached. https://redeivg.org.br) unable to be reached. https://www.redeivg.org.br/relatorios-sociais/ connection successful. https://cedeponline.com.br), unable to be reached. https://ajp2.org.br/), unable to be reached. https://munfred.com connection successful.

7603,Pode Crer: Tech education for marginalized youth,4,0x6Dbd02e2CD85A443318ebEd00aeeDB0fd09ee86e,"This grant will fund scholarships of $45/mo (200 brazilian reais per month) to support 200 Brazilian youth from marginalized communities studying in the Pode Crer project of technology education. Pode Crer is already running until December 2022. Pode Crer is free, but many of the students come from very poor families and face a dilemma between studying and working to help their families - $45 is extremely impactful and helps keep students in the program until completion. 



What is the Pode Crer program?

Pode Crer (name after a portuguese expression that literally translates to ""one can believe"" but on daily use means something like ""right on!"") is a new technology and leadership education program tailored to bring youth from Brazilian marginalized communities into the knowledge economy. It is conceived and executed by the Vilson Groh Institute, an organization with a 40-year history of grassroots work focused in education, creating opportunity, promoting inclusion in the challenging social context of Brazilian marginalized communities. Today the Vilson Groh Institute supports a network of 8 educational and social organizations that reaches 6000 students and supports 20000 people.

Pode Crer is the synthesis of these 40 years of experience into a scalable educational methodology. Pode Crer has an innovative integrative educational approach that blends technology, citizenship, communication and leadership skills. 

In 2021 the program ran with 320 participants, and in 2022 with 300 participants across three educational tracks for ages 11-14, 14-18 and 18+. Over the next years the Vilson Groh Institute envisions building five Social Innovation Centers across marginalized communities in the greater Florianópolis region. These will serve as hubs for consolidation and expansion of the Pode Crer program, and as laboratories for incubation of social projects and experimentation.

Pode Crer 2021 Impact 

320 students participated in the 2021 iteration of Pode Crer. Of 200 students aged 14+, over 66 got job opportunities, 37 of them in technology, and 7 students were admitted to public universities. In marginalized communities this kind of impact is life changing - many participants never used a computer before. These are youth whose default career path would be to join drug trafficking, or at best low paying unskilled jobs. We are in talks with a Brazilian researcher from J-PAL (Abdul Latif Jameel Poverty Action Lab) interested in doing rigorous impact evaluation and writing an academic study that will inform public policy in Brazil and the world. 

If excess funds are raised, they will be directed for the 2023 implementation of Pode Crer, which is budgeted  at USD 250k (BRL 1.2M) but currently faces funding uncertainty due to the elections in Brazil. If more than USD 250k are raised, the excess funds will be directed towards the construction of the first social innovation center, which is budgeted at USD 1.2M (BRL 6M). If even more is raised, we will continue building social innovation centers, we already have the location for the first 5 selected.

The Pode Crer Vision 

We want to break the cycle of urban misery, violence and deliberate exclusion in Brazil through Pode Crer, an innovative complementary education targeting vulnerable youth, and to provide an example that can be replicated across the country and other developing nations. Pode Crer is conceived and executed by the Vilson Groh Institute, a Brazilian nonprofit with a 40-year history that coordinates and supports a network of eight schools, educational centers and social organizations in the Greater Florianópolis region that reaches 6000 students and impacts over 20000 people. The institute’s focus is on social justice and uplifting marginalized communities in Brazil through education.

Pode Crer is a new complementary education program and methodology created to shape the future of Brazilian education and society. It aims to prepare students to be engaged leaders in society and active participants in the knowledge economy. Pode Crer implements a new educational approach and curriculum that blends technology, citizenship and communication. It is underpinned by the development of leadership skills in students, tested in the challenging social context of Brazilian marginalized communities, where the program is implemented. 

Pode Crer currently takes place in the city of Florianópolis, in the south of Brazil. Is divided into three educational tracks for ages 11-13, 14-17 and 18-24. The pilot program took place in 2021 with 320 young people in a hybrid format. In May 2022, its second iteration began, in a fully face-to-face format, with 300 young people, some of whom participated in 2021. Pode Crer is free and open for all.

The long-term vision of Pode Crer is to provide complementary education from birth to university age. To enable this vision and to serve as hubs for the implementation and growth of Pode Crer, five Social Innovation Centers will be created across the greater Florianópolis region in locations close to partner organizations. These centers will have state-of-the-art infrastructure to offer all the educational tracks of Pode Crer continuously. The first center is planned to open by 2023 in the community of Monte Serrat in Florianópolis, where Vilson Groh lives, and to completely reinvent the community's image. It will feature a maker space, computer labs, classrooms and workshops, auditorium, library, co-working spaces and social spaces.


About the Vilson Groh Institute
Pode Crer is conceived and executed by the Vilson Groh Institute,  a Brazilian nonprofit that  coordinates and supports a network of eight schools, educational centers and social organizations in the Greater Florianópolis region. The institute’s focus is on social justice and uplifting marginalized communities in Brazil through education.

The Institute and its partner organizations have a long history of success creating new educational programs serving marginalized communities and vulnerable populations in the most challenging situations in Brazil, in the midst of urban misery and violence. Because of this long experience and its institutional management capacity, the Vilson Groh Institute and its partner organizations are in a unique position to create, operationalize, and refine bold new educational initiatives for Brazil. 

This network of organizations was built over 40 years of work by Vilson Groh and many other engaged individuals in marginalized and impoverished communities. At the age of 22 Vilson moved to the community of Monte Serrat in Florianópolis and never left. Now 68 years old and going strong, Vilson Groh’s vision and passion have blossomed into a network coordinating about 400 volunteers from all social classes. Their primary focus is on education and creating opportunities for young people in vulnerable situations.

The big picture problem
We want to break the cycle of urban misery, violence and deliberate exclusion in Brazil through an innovative complementary education targeting vulnerable youth, and to provide an example that can be replicated across the country and serve as an example for other nations. 


Global urban misery, violence, subhuman living conditions and extreme inequality was caused by growing population coupled with fast and disorganized urbanization in the developing world over the past 100 years: The fraction of global urban population went from 15% to 60%, and global population went from 1.9B to 7.8B people. 


Brazil is one of the most unequal countries in the world, and one of the most extreme cases of rapid and completely disorganized urbanization: total population went from 30M to 212M, and urban population from 15% to 85%, with 40 times more people living in cities today than 100 years ago. 


The thorny problem of urban misery interwoven with violence and extreme inequality is most emblematically represented by the images of the favelas of Rio de Janeiro amid the backdrop of luxury condos, but the dynamic is consistently repeated across every major city in Brazil.

We have a scalable program,Pode Crer, now in its second pilot year, that achieves this by equipping youth with technical and socio-emotional skills to participate in the knowledge economy, and we have the capacity to scale it: across 8 organizations in our network we have over 40 years of experience and dozens of educational programs that reach over 6000 students and impact 20,000 people in communities across the greater Florianópolis region in Brazil. 

Creating an inclusive knowledge economy and a society of leaders
The Pode Crer program and methodology aims at nothing less than reinventing basic education in Brazil, and consequently the future of the country's human development. The strategy is to begin this transformation through complementary education, where it is possible to innovate, iterate and be bold.

Pode Crer operates in the opposite period to the public school system (in Brazil classes happen in mornings or afternoons only) and is therefore free from many of the shackles of the education system. Pode Crer develops fundamental elements that are absent in the public education system and aims to become such a shining example of success that other educational organizations will copy it, and eventually shape the public education system itself. 

While Pode Crer is currently implemented in three educational tracks for students aged 11 to 24 years old, the long term vision is to continuously guide students from one track to another, and to be expanded to offer complementary training from kindergarten to university. 

The curriculum has three foundations: technology, citizenship, and communication. They were designed to prepare the student to actively participate in the knowledge economy, which demands skills that are not part of the Brazilian education system. 

Beyond just technical skills, the fundamental element important is the ability to work well with people. Developing autonomy, communication and teamwork for working in a creative and dynamic environment demands emotional intelligence, awareness and self-confidence. These are elements that form the foundation of leadership, explicitly developed and improved by CEOs and executives, but typically ignored in other contexts. Creating an inclusive knowledge economy that is not insular and elitist requires developing these elements in all individuals as part of the educational system. This means creating a society of leaders.

The full development of a knowledge economy also requires a society with functioning institutions and high levels of interpersonal trust. In Brazil these elements are still fraught and often absent. The country has institutions that are an important foundation but are still young and fragile. It is necessary to change Brazil's pervasive culture of corruption. This culture manifests itself through a generalized mindset of trying to get ahead of others, usually by skirting the rules or disregarding what is public and common. It is necessary to inculcate civic mindedness into every Brazilian, and a genuine regard for everything that is common, shared and public. 

When implemented on a national scale, Pode Crer will be paving the way in Brazil for the creation of a society of leaders with an inclusive knowledge economy - something that still does not truly exist anywhere in the world. The creation of an inclusive knowledge economy is the only sustainable way of closing the great social gaps in Brazil. In an economy where everyone actually participates, it is not necessary to permanently resort to assistance programs or income redistribution. 

Current plans: Creating 5 Social Innovation Centers
The plan for the growth of Pode Crer in the near future is the creation of multiple Social Innovation Centers throughout the greater Florianópolis region, in communities where the Vilson Groh Institute operates. These centers will be structures built close to partner educational organizations that have already implemented or will implement Pode Crer educational tracks.   

The first center will be built in the community of Monte Serrat.. It will be built on land given over for 30 years, alongside a partner school. It will have an amphitheater for events, an interactive library, a coworking space, a music studio, a maker space, classrooms and computer labs. Its construction is budgeted at 6 million reais (1.2M USD). About 20% of the resources for its construction are already secured. 

After Monte Serrat neighborhood the next two centers will be built in the Monte Cristo neighborhood in Florianópolis and at Ponte do Imaruim in Palhoça. The first is home to CEDEP (https://cedeponline.com.br), a popular and experimental education center that has 30 years of experience with complementary education. CEDEP carries out innovative educational experiments with vulnerable youth based on the philosophy of Brazilian educator Paulo Freire. The second location is home to the AJPII elementary school (https://ajp2.org.br/), where the Pode Crer track 1 pilot takes place (11 -13 years). 



Location and proposed design of the first social innovation center in the community of Monte Serrtat in Florianópolis, Brazil. 



If you were given $500M what would you do? 

With $500M we would have a 25x more ambitious 10-year plan: Instead of 5, we would create 125 social innovation centers in marginalized communities (favelas) across Brazil. These centers will be hubs for Pode Crer, our new complementary education program created to prepare vulnerable and marginalized youth for the knowledge economy. Pode Crer launched in 2021 and currently serves 300 students across two communities aged 11-24, being free and open to all. 

Pode Crer is a new educational approach tailored to Brazilian reality that blends civics, technology and leadership, equipping youth with technical and socio-emotional skills to participate in the knowledge economy. It is based on over 40 years of experience working with marginalized communities across 8 educational organizations reaching 6000 students. 

Because Pode Crer is a complementary education program (running in the opposite shift to schools) it is free of constraints of the Brazilian school system. We can innovate and iterate rapidly. 

The first center will open in 2023. Each center costs $1M to build and $500k per year to operate in full. A center can serve 600 Pode Crer students and reaches about 5000 community members. Each center is planned to be staffed by 12 educators and 8 support staff. 

We have the institutional capacity to operate and grow Pode Crer. We are bottlenecked by fundraising. We are confident that if we have the money we can train and grow our team of educators by 50% each year. With $5M we could have these 5 centers built and operational by 2027. With $500M we would aim to create and operate 125 centers across Brazil by 2033. Instead of just the ​​Florianópolis region, we would like to influence educational policy and reshape education in Brazil. 

We are talking with the Stanford University “Lemann Center for Educational Entrepreneurship Innovation in Brazil” to create studies about Pode Crer. Our goal is to put out rigorous studies to guide policy and pave the way to grow across Brazil. 

The city of Medellin in Colombia has a successful “smart city” experience that informs our vision. Since the 1990s over different governments they were able to drastically reduce violence and improve life quality by re-urbanization and creating community centers in strategic locations. There are two main differences: First, our approach starts from a focus on lifelong education, while in Medellin it started from a re-urbanization plan. Second: In Medellin action started from the city government and engaged civil society, while we are starting from civil society and engaging multiple city governments. 

Crucial partners we need to engage are local governments. We have deep ties with civil society in the Florianópolis region, and we work with 3 other different city governments. We believe that cities across Brazil will be receptive to our experience. Investment in our programs can be done in tranches. If we receive $5M today in a few years we will have multiple centers operating and conclusive results to support further investment in 3-4 years. 



If Pode Crer was ultimately successful and fully implemented, how would the world be different?

 If we truly succeed, then every one of the 50 million youth in Brazil aged 18 and under will have access to lifelong complementary education shaped after the Pode Crer approach. That means education tailored to their local realities, that teaches a civic mindset, and to equip them with the technical and socio-emotional skills needed to thrive in the knowledge economy. 

We have a long term vision of lifelong education, and want to support people from birth to adult age. We are looking beyond the 10 year plan outlined for the $500M, which would reach  an estimated 75k Pode Crer students and 625k people across the 125 social innovation centers. A 25 year horizon would be more coherent with the scale of our vision.

To have such a broad impact we need to influence education policy at the city, state and national level in Brazil. We believe we can do that in two ways. First by publishing rigorous academic studies that show to policy makers the efficacy of our educational approach and enabling evidence-based policy making - we are already talking with the Lemann Center at Stanford to create such rigorous studies.  Second, by having each social innovation center serve as a reference for how to implement the program and adapt it to a new community, and as a hub for training educators and program managers. We believe that as soon as the first center is completed in 2023 this will happen, and we will be ready to assist organizations outside our network on how to implement our approach. 

If we truly achieve our vision, then we will have an integrated society, city center and urban periphery will not be segregated and stigmatized. We will have broken with the vicious cycle of obscene urban exclusion that occurs in Brazil. We will have achieved this by creating an inclusive knowledge economy in Brazil. That is to say, a society in which every individual in working age is able to participate in the knowledge economy. Currently this doesn’t exist in any country yet, because participation in the knowledge economy requires significant training that only relatively few elite workers have, making their labor extremely valuable. This inequality in training leads to significant social and economic inequality, as is becoming more evident every day across the US and in particular in Silicon Valley, where technology workers command salaries far higher than any other industry. 

In his book “​​The Knowledge Economy”, Harvard Brazilian scholar Roberto Mangabeira Unger describes the knowledge economy as insular and exclusive, and he advocates for a new kind of educational system in Brazil geared towards enfranchising people to participate in it. We believe Pode Crer is exactly that, and we are working every day to consolidate and grow the program. 

If we succeed then rather than be marginalized, every community in Brazil will be empowered  to solve their own problems, and be able to leverage modern technology. Instead of squandering youth to drug trafficking and violence with no human development, we will create a society of leaders with a civic mindset and an understanding of the powerful technologies they have at their disposal to improve the world. This will start with local communities, but it will grow: these empowered leaders will become more and more active participants in society, from companies to civic organizations to local, state and national governments. That kind of civic engagement is what Brazil needs and what we wish to foster through lifelong education with a long term vision. 

We expect that our experience will serve as a template for other countries. The world would be different because through education and opportunity, underprivileged communities would be the protagonist of their rise from misery and poverty. Not big companies, not governments, but individuals themselves will have the sense of agency, the confidence, and the skills to do so. 



What bottlenecks is keeping us from quickly scaling Pode Crer?

Immediate funding needs: USD 250k to guarantee operations for 2023
Because of the election year, there is very high uncertainty that we will be able to secure funds from CAIXA, the federal bank that funded Pode Crer in 2021 and 2022 with 1M BRL ($200k).

Going beyond the minimum: scalable growth with social innovation centers


Pode Crer was designed for scalable growth, with plans to create 5 social innovation centers to serve as hubs of the program in communities where the Vilson Groh Institute already operates. Each center is designed to serve up to 1000 Pode Crer students and reach 20.000 people.

A center costs $1.2M to build and $300k/year to operate in full with 12 staff, and features a maker space, computer labs, classrooms and workshops, auditorium, library, co-working spaces and social spaces.  To make things happen faster, the strategy is to raise private money to build the first centers quickly while securing government support for ongoing operational costs. If money is secured the first center can be made operational in 2023.



Operating Budget - currently $250k/year for 300 youth
The 2022 implementation is supported by a team of 21 people, including educators, social workers, pedagogues and administrators. The budget for 2022 is R$1.2M (250k USD). Today Pode Crer is implemented as two weekly meetings in the morning or in the afternoon, in classes of up to 25 students who have classes and workshops on two topics a day. 

The primary bottleneck for immediately scaling Pode Crer is money, the 2022 budget is $250k and the program runs two days a week with 300 students total. Because we are only able to hire the educators as part-time staff, we could readily double the capacity of the program if we had twice the money ($500k) and reach 600 students total.

In the current two-day-a-week format, a team of 4 educators working full-time could serve 400 students on each educational track. To offer the program 5 days a week to 400 students, a team of 8 educators would be required. Currently, the two biggest limitations for the Program are financial resources to hire the entire team as full-time staff (many can only be paid part time), and physical space for the program's activities. It is possible to double the reach of the program with the current team and twice the financial resources, with an yearly operating budget of R$2.4M (about 500k USD).

Student support scholarships ($40/mo)

Another challenge that we face is keeping students in class and getting some families to not pressure students to leave class to seek work, which is common with the vulnerable students from marginalized communities. Students on tracks 2 and 3 receive an allowance of R$200 (USD 40) per month during the program. This allowance is fundamental to incentivize them and their families to focus on studies rather than procuring work to supplement family income. 


Physical space and locations
The secondary bottleneck is location and physical space, getting to the classroom is challenging for many students, even with financial support for transport that we offer. Currently, Pode Crer is implemented in two locations due to the availability of spaces in two partner organizations and 3 educational tracks for ages 11-13 (track 1), 14-17 (track 2) and 18-24 (track 3). Tracks 2 and 3 are implemented in the city of Florianópolis and track 1 in the city of Palhoça. They serve very different communities and audiences, with different cultures. This creates a challenge for the consolidation of Pode Crer, as it is necessary to ensure coherence in the implementation of the program at each pole. But it also creates a huge opportunity for the developed methodology to be extremely robust. If all trails can be successfully implemented in two locations with distinct communities and cultures, this suggests that the implementation will be robust in new locations and cultures. 

To address the space and transport issues we want to build the first social innovation center in the heart of the community of Monte Serrat in Florianópolis where we have worked for many decades. It will provide high quality teaching spaces, technology labs, a library, makerspace, co-working space and socialization areas. As we expand the program we want to learn from this center to improve the design and implementation of the next ones. With more space and resources it will be possible to offer optional activities on the other 3 days of the week. Immediate possibilities that we would like to implement are focused workshops on technology, sports, culture, and to develop communication and leadership skills in smaller groups. 

Team growth
Finally, in order to truly scale, we will face the challenge of training and developing our team of educators. Currently we have hundreds of educators and staff in the organizations, and the 2022 implementation of Pode Crer supported by a team of 21 people, educators, social workers, pedagogues and administrators. We are very confident that we have the capacity to grow the team of educators by 50% each year, which would be sufficient to realize the vision of 125 centers with 12 educators and 8 support staff in each by 2033. We have the capacity to select good people, and train them in our educational approach, and to make them effective educators in the challenging contexts of Brazilian marginalized communities. What we need are a modicum of resources to make this vision happen even faster. If we receive $5M today in a few years we will have multiple centers operating and conclusive results to support further investment in 3-4 years.

The story of Vilson Groh
---------------------------------------------
Vilson Groh is a Catholic priest who in 1979 moved to the marginalized community of Monte Serrat in Florianópolis and devoted his life to enfranchising marginalized communities, using lifelong education and advocacy to bridge pervasive urban exclusion. This work continues today: now 68, living in the same place in Monte Serrat and still going strong, Vilson continues to use the respect, goodwill and convening power he earned over a lifetime of work dedicated to others to advance social justice through education and community.


Vilson was born and raised in Brusque, a city founded by German immigrants in 1860 in the state of Santa Catarina. He came to Florianópolis in 1978 to pursue graduate studies at the Federal University of Santa Catarina (UFSC). Soon after Vilson moved to the marginalized community of Monte Serrat in Florianópolis, which back then had no running water, sewage, paved roads, electricity or any kind of service. It was the quintessential favela, a Brazilian shantytown growing uphill without any kind of government oversight or regard, with rampant crime, violence and drug trafficking
 Vilson devoted his life to enfranchising marginalized communities, using lifelong education and advocacy to bridge pervasive urban exclusion, and this work continues today. For decades Vilson lived like the poorest, in a wooden hut, like most people around him. For that to change it took his mother demanding that he live with a modicum of dignity when many around him had brick and mortar houses, she refused to visit him for a year. He finally upscaled into a humble two bedroom brick and mortar house built by the community in that spot, where Vilson continues to live today. 
Every day Vilson uses the respect, goodwill and convening power he earned over a lifetime of work dedicated to others to advance social justice through education, community and helping literally everyone in need.


---------------------------------------------
The Vilson Groh Network
---------------------------------------------

Through Vilson Groh’s leadership and that of many others, small projects have flourished and became reference organizations in communities. As time went on other organizations joined the movement, and the Vilson Groh Institute was founded in 2011, to strengthen the actions of these organizations already under the leadership of Vilson Groh.
It should be highlighted that all of this work is performed in violent and marginalized communities in an extremely challenging educational context: students are initially violent, aloof, brute, emotionally undeveloped, and often going hungry. This network approach only works because every educator, volunteer and supporter is sensible and deeply aware of the realities in each community, and the Institute is extremely good at training educators. The network works through a holistic approach and engage with everyone involved: students, parents, families and the community, meeting social reality, constantly reassessing it and adjusting our approach.
Today the organizations that compose the Vilson Groh Network are:
== CEDEP (Center for Popular Education) - an experimental community educational organization created from scratch based on Paulo Freire’s philosophy complementary education for 600 youth and continuing education for adults
== AJPII (John Paul II association) - a school for children an and adolescent education where track 1 of Pode Crer is executed
== MESLM (Marist School Lucia Mayvorne) - free full time education for about 500 children and adolescents

Personal Statement from Eduardo da Veiga Beltrame - https://munfred.com - eduardo@redeivg.org.br
I have been a very strong supporter of Pode Crer from the start, being in close contact with the Vilson Groh Institute leadership, and with over $120k donations of my own money (most of my wealth). I donated most of my would-be salary, money from a house sale in Brazil, and gave them computers, equipment, 3D printers and robotics kits. In 2022 I did a 5 week deep dive across all organizations of the Vilson Groh Institute, I talked to all the teachers, students, staff, community members, and spent a lot of time with the leaders of each organization. I also gave several 3D printing workshops to teachers and students, to make sure I understood day to day reality. 

I believe Pode Crer offers a template for the future of education in Brazil and Latin America. I am extremely confident in their exceptional institutional management and in their ability to operationalize programs and train and grow teams of educators. The Vilson Groh Institute is the right institution to spearhead this change, to iterate and refine such an ambitious program, and to work with cities and governments to implement what works as public policy.","Valid Ethereum Address. https://vilsongroh.org connection successful. https://redeivg.org.br/podecrer connection successful. https://www.brazilfoundation.org/podecrerfund/ connection successful. https://www.redeivg.org.br/doe-agora/ connection successful. https://munfred.com) unable to be reached. https://redeivg.org.br) unable to be reached. https://www.redeivg.org.br/relatorios-sociais/ connection successful. https://cedeponline.com.br), unable to be reached. https://ajp2.org.br/), unable to be reached. https://munfred.com connection successful.

7603,Pode Crer: Tech education for marginalized youth,4,0x6Dbd02e2CD85A443318ebEd00aeeDB0fd09ee86e,"This grant will fund scholarships of $45/mo (200 brazilian reais per month) to support 200 Brazilian youth from marginalized communities studying in the Pode Crer project of technology education. Pode Crer is already running until December 2022. Pode Crer is free, but many of the students come from very poor families and face a dilemma between studying and working to help their families - $45 is extremely impactful and helps keep students in the program until completion. 



What is the Pode Crer program?

Pode Crer (name after a portuguese expression that literally translates to ""one can believe"" but on daily use means something like ""right on!"") is a new technology and leadership education program tailored to bring youth from Brazilian marginalized communities into the knowledge economy. It is conceived and executed by the Vilson Groh Institute, an organization with a 40-year history of grassroots work focused in education, creating opportunity, promoting inclusion in the challenging social context of Brazilian marginalized communities. Today the Vilson Groh Institute supports a network of 8 educational and social organizations that reaches 6000 students and supports 20000 people.

Pode Crer is the synthesis of these 40 years of experience into a scalable educational methodology. Pode Crer has an innovative integrative educational approach that blends technology, citizenship, communication and leadership skills. 

In 2021 the program ran with 320 participants, and in 2022 with 300 participants across three educational tracks for ages 11-14, 14-18 and 18+. Over the next years the Vilson Groh Institute envisions building five Social Innovation Centers across marginalized communities in the greater Florianópolis region. These will serve as hubs for consolidation and expansion of the Pode Crer program, and as laboratories for incubation of social projects and experimentation.

Pode Crer 2021 Impact 

320 students participated in the 2021 iteration of Pode Crer. Of 200 students aged 14+, over 66 got job opportunities, 37 of them in technology, and 7 students were admitted to public universities. In marginalized communities this kind of impact is life changing - many participants never used a computer before. These are youth whose default career path would be to join drug trafficking, or at best low paying unskilled jobs. We are in talks with a Brazilian researcher from J-PAL (Abdul Latif Jameel Poverty Action Lab) interested in doing rigorous impact evaluation and writing an academic study that will inform public policy in Brazil and the world. 

If excess funds are raised, they will be directed for the 2023 implementation of Pode Crer, which is budgeted  at USD 250k (BRL 1.2M) but currently faces funding uncertainty due to the elections in Brazil. If more than USD 250k are raised, the excess funds will be directed towards the construction of the first social innovation center, which is budgeted at USD 1.2M (BRL 6M). If even more is raised, we will continue building social innovation centers, we already have the location for the first 5 selected.

The Pode Crer Vision 

We want to break the cycle of urban misery, violence and deliberate exclusion in Brazil through Pode Crer, an innovative complementary education targeting vulnerable youth, and to provide an example that can be replicated across the country and other developing nations. Pode Crer is conceived and executed by the Vilson Groh Institute, a Brazilian nonprofit with a 40-year history that coordinates and supports a network of eight schools, educational centers and social organizations in the Greater Florianópolis region that reaches 6000 students and impacts over 20000 people. The institute’s focus is on social justice and uplifting marginalized communities in Brazil through education.

Pode Crer is a new complementary education program and methodology created to shape the future of Brazilian education and society. It aims to prepare students to be engaged leaders in society and active participants in the knowledge economy. Pode Crer implements a new educational approach and curriculum that blends technology, citizenship and communication. It is underpinned by the development of leadership skills in students, tested in the challenging social context of Brazilian marginalized communities, where the program is implemented. 

Pode Crer currently takes place in the city of Florianópolis, in the south of Brazil. Is divided into three educational tracks for ages 11-13, 14-17 and 18-24. The pilot program took place in 2021 with 320 young people in a hybrid format. In May 2022, its second iteration began, in a fully face-to-face format, with 300 young people, some of whom participated in 2021. Pode Crer is free and open for all.

The long-term vision of Pode Crer is to provide complementary education from birth to university age. To enable this vision and to serve as hubs for the implementation and growth of Pode Crer, five Social Innovation Centers will be created across the greater Florianópolis region in locations close to partner organizations. These centers will have state-of-the-art infrastructure to offer all the educational tracks of Pode Crer continuously. The first center is planned to open by 2023 in the community of Monte Serrat in Florianópolis, where Vilson Groh lives, and to completely reinvent the community's image. It will feature a maker space, computer labs, classrooms and workshops, auditorium, library, co-working spaces and social spaces.


About the Vilson Groh Institute
Pode Crer is conceived and executed by the Vilson Groh Institute,  a Brazilian nonprofit that  coordinates and supports a network of eight schools, educational centers and social organizations in the Greater Florianópolis region. The institute’s focus is on social justice and uplifting marginalized communities in Brazil through education.

The Institute and its partner organizations have a long history of success creating new educational programs serving marginalized communities and vulnerable populations in the most challenging situations in Brazil, in the midst of urban misery and violence. Because of this long experience and its institutional management capacity, the Vilson Groh Institute and its partner organizations are in a unique position to create, operationalize, and refine bold new educational initiatives for Brazil. 

This network of organizations was built over 40 years of work by Vilson Groh and many other engaged individuals in marginalized and impoverished communities. At the age of 22 Vilson moved to the community of Monte Serrat in Florianópolis and never left. Now 68 years old and going strong, Vilson Groh’s vision and passion have blossomed into a network coordinating about 400 volunteers from all social classes. Their primary focus is on education and creating opportunities for young people in vulnerable situations.

The big picture problem
We want to break the cycle of urban misery, violence and deliberate exclusion in Brazil through an innovative complementary education targeting vulnerable youth, and to provide an example that can be replicated across the country and serve as an example for other nations. 


Global urban misery, violence, subhuman living conditions and extreme inequality was caused by growing population coupled with fast and disorganized urbanization in the developing world over the past 100 years: The fraction of global urban population went from 15% to 60%, and global population went from 1.9B to 7.8B people. 


Brazil is one of the most unequal countries in the world, and one of the most extreme cases of rapid and completely disorganized urbanization: total population went from 30M to 212M, and urban population from 15% to 85%, with 40 times more people living in cities today than 100 years ago. 


The thorny problem of urban misery interwoven with violence and extreme inequality is most emblematically represented by the images of the favelas of Rio de Janeiro amid the backdrop of luxury condos, but the dynamic is consistently repeated across every major city in Brazil.

We have a scalable program,Pode Crer, now in its second pilot year, that achieves this by equipping youth with technical and socio-emotional skills to participate in the knowledge economy, and we have the capacity to scale it: across 8 organizations in our network we have over 40 years of experience and dozens of educational programs that reach over 6000 students and impact 20,000 people in communities across the greater Florianópolis region in Brazil. 

Creating an inclusive knowledge economy and a society of leaders
The Pode Crer program and methodology aims at nothing less than reinventing basic education in Brazil, and consequently the future of the country's human development. The strategy is to begin this transformation through complementary education, where it is possible to innovate, iterate and be bold.

Pode Crer operates in the opposite period to the public school system (in Brazil classes happen in mornings or afternoons only) and is therefore free from many of the shackles of the education system. Pode Crer develops fundamental elements that are absent in the public education system and aims to become such a shining example of success that other educational organizations will copy it, and eventually shape the public education system itself. 

While Pode Crer is currently implemented in three educational tracks for students aged 11 to 24 years old, the long term vision is to continuously guide students from one track to another, and to be expanded to offer complementary training from kindergarten to university. 

The curriculum has three foundations: technology, citizenship, and communication. They were designed to prepare the student to actively participate in the knowledge economy, which demands skills that are not part of the Brazilian education system. 

Beyond just technical skills, the fundamental element important is the ability to work well with people. Developing autonomy, communication and teamwork for working in a creative and dynamic environment demands emotional intelligence, awareness and self-confidence. These are elements that form the foundation of leadership, explicitly developed and improved by CEOs and executives, but typically ignored in other contexts. Creating an inclusive knowledge economy that is not insular and elitist requires developing these elements in all individuals as part of the educational system. This means creating a society of leaders.

The full development of a knowledge economy also requires a society with functioning institutions and high levels of interpersonal trust. In Brazil these elements are still fraught and often absent. The country has institutions that are an important foundation but are still young and fragile. It is necessary to change Brazil's pervasive culture of corruption. This culture manifests itself through a generalized mindset of trying to get ahead of others, usually by skirting the rules or disregarding what is public and common. It is necessary to inculcate civic mindedness into every Brazilian, and a genuine regard for everything that is common, shared and public. 

When implemented on a national scale, Pode Crer will be paving the way in Brazil for the creation of a society of leaders with an inclusive knowledge economy - something that still does not truly exist anywhere in the world. The creation of an inclusive knowledge economy is the only sustainable way of closing the great social gaps in Brazil. In an economy where everyone actually participates, it is not necessary to permanently resort to assistance programs or income redistribution. 

Current plans: Creating 5 Social Innovation Centers
The plan for the growth of Pode Crer in the near future is the creation of multiple Social Innovation Centers throughout the greater Florianópolis region, in communities where the Vilson Groh Institute operates. These centers will be structures built close to partner educational organizations that have already implemented or will implement Pode Crer educational tracks.   

The first center will be built in the community of Monte Serrat.. It will be built on land given over for 30 years, alongside a partner school. It will have an amphitheater for events, an interactive library, a coworking space, a music studio, a maker space, classrooms and computer labs. Its construction is budgeted at 6 million reais (1.2M USD). About 20% of the resources for its construction are already secured. 

After Monte Serrat neighborhood the next two centers will be built in the Monte Cristo neighborhood in Florianópolis and at Ponte do Imaruim in Palhoça. The first is home to CEDEP (https://cedeponline.com.br), a popular and experimental education center that has 30 years of experience with complementary education. CEDEP carries out innovative educational experiments with vulnerable youth based on the philosophy of Brazilian educator Paulo Freire. The second location is home to the AJPII elementary school (https://ajp2.org.br/), where the Pode Crer track 1 pilot takes place (11 -13 years). 



Location and proposed design of the first social innovation center in the community of Monte Serrtat in Florianópolis, Brazil. 



If you were given $500M what would you do? 

With $500M we would have a 25x more ambitious 10-year plan: Instead of 5, we would create 125 social innovation centers in marginalized communities (favelas) across Brazil. These centers will be hubs for Pode Crer, our new complementary education program created to prepare vulnerable and marginalized youth for the knowledge economy. Pode Crer launched in 2021 and currently serves 300 students across two communities aged 11-24, being free and open to all. 

Pode Crer is a new educational approach tailored to Brazilian reality that blends civics, technology and leadership, equipping youth with technical and socio-emotional skills to participate in the knowledge economy. It is based on over 40 years of experience working with marginalized communities across 8 educational organizations reaching 6000 students. 

Because Pode Crer is a complementary education program (running in the opposite shift to schools) it is free of constraints of the Brazilian school system. We can innovate and iterate rapidly. 

The first center will open in 2023. Each center costs $1M to build and $500k per year to operate in full. A center can serve 600 Pode Crer students and reaches about 5000 community members. Each center is planned to be staffed by 12 educators and 8 support staff. 

We have the institutional capacity to operate and grow Pode Crer. We are bottlenecked by fundraising. We are confident that if we have the money we can train and grow our team of educators by 50% each year. With $5M we could have these 5 centers built and operational by 2027. With $500M we would aim to create and operate 125 centers across Brazil by 2033. Instead of just the ​​Florianópolis region, we would like to influence educational policy and reshape education in Brazil. 

We are talking with the Stanford University “Lemann Center for Educational Entrepreneurship Innovation in Brazil” to create studies about Pode Crer. Our goal is to put out rigorous studies to guide policy and pave the way to grow across Brazil. 

The city of Medellin in Colombia has a successful “smart city” experience that informs our vision. Since the 1990s over different governments they were able to drastically reduce violence and improve life quality by re-urbanization and creating community centers in strategic locations. There are two main differences: First, our approach starts from a focus on lifelong education, while in Medellin it started from a re-urbanization plan. Second: In Medellin action started from the city government and engaged civil society, while we are starting from civil society and engaging multiple city governments. 

Crucial partners we need to engage are local governments. We have deep ties with civil society in the Florianópolis region, and we work with 3 other different city governments. We believe that cities across Brazil will be receptive to our experience. Investment in our programs can be done in tranches. If we receive $5M today in a few years we will have multiple centers operating and conclusive results to support further investment in 3-4 years. 



If Pode Crer was ultimately successful and fully implemented, how would the world be different?

 If we truly succeed, then every one of the 50 million youth in Brazil aged 18 and under will have access to lifelong complementary education shaped after the Pode Crer approach. That means education tailored to their local realities, that teaches a civic mindset, and to equip them with the technical and socio-emotional skills needed to thrive in the knowledge economy. 

We have a long term vision of lifelong education, and want to support people from birth to adult age. We are looking beyond the 10 year plan outlined for the $500M, which would reach  an estimated 75k Pode Crer students and 625k people across the 125 social innovation centers. A 25 year horizon would be more coherent with the scale of our vision.

To have such a broad impact we need to influence education policy at the city, state and national level in Brazil. We believe we can do that in two ways. First by publishing rigorous academic studies that show to policy makers the efficacy of our educational approach and enabling evidence-based policy making - we are already talking with the Lemann Center at Stanford to create such rigorous studies.  Second, by having each social innovation center serve as a reference for how to implement the program and adapt it to a new community, and as a hub for training educators and program managers. We believe that as soon as the first center is completed in 2023 this will happen, and we will be ready to assist organizations outside our network on how to implement our approach. 

If we truly achieve our vision, then we will have an integrated society, city center and urban periphery will not be segregated and stigmatized. We will have broken with the vicious cycle of obscene urban exclusion that occurs in Brazil. We will have achieved this by creating an inclusive knowledge economy in Brazil. That is to say, a society in which every individual in working age is able to participate in the knowledge economy. Currently this doesn’t exist in any country yet, because participation in the knowledge economy requires significant training that only relatively few elite workers have, making their labor extremely valuable. This inequality in training leads to significant social and economic inequality, as is becoming more evident every day across the US and in particular in Silicon Valley, where technology workers command salaries far higher than any other industry. 

In his book “​​The Knowledge Economy”, Harvard Brazilian scholar Roberto Mangabeira Unger describes the knowledge economy as insular and exclusive, and he advocates for a new kind of educational system in Brazil geared towards enfranchising people to participate in it. We believe Pode Crer is exactly that, and we are working every day to consolidate and grow the program. 

If we succeed then rather than be marginalized, every community in Brazil will be empowered  to solve their own problems, and be able to leverage modern technology. Instead of squandering youth to drug trafficking and violence with no human development, we will create a society of leaders with a civic mindset and an understanding of the powerful technologies they have at their disposal to improve the world. This will start with local communities, but it will grow: these empowered leaders will become more and more active participants in society, from companies to civic organizations to local, state and national governments. That kind of civic engagement is what Brazil needs and what we wish to foster through lifelong education with a long term vision. 

We expect that our experience will serve as a template for other countries. The world would be different because through education and opportunity, underprivileged communities would be the protagonist of their rise from misery and poverty. Not big companies, not governments, but individuals themselves will have the sense of agency, the confidence, and the skills to do so. 



What bottlenecks is keeping us from quickly scaling Pode Crer?

Immediate funding needs: USD 250k to guarantee operations for 2023
Because of the election year, there is very high uncertainty that we will be able to secure funds from CAIXA, the federal bank that funded Pode Crer in 2021 and 2022 with 1M BRL ($200k).

Going beyond the minimum: scalable growth with social innovation centers


Pode Crer was designed for scalable growth, with plans to create 5 social innovation centers to serve as hubs of the program in communities where the Vilson Groh Institute already operates. Each center is designed to serve up to 1000 Pode Crer students and reach 20.000 people.

A center costs $1.2M to build and $300k/year to operate in full with 12 staff, and features a maker space, computer labs, classrooms and workshops, auditorium, library, co-working spaces and social spaces.  To make things happen faster, the strategy is to raise private money to build the first centers quickly while securing government support for ongoing operational costs. If money is secured the first center can be made operational in 2023.



Operating Budget - currently $250k/year for 300 youth
The 2022 implementation is supported by a team of 21 people, including educators, social workers, pedagogues and administrators. The budget for 2022 is R$1.2M (250k USD). Today Pode Crer is implemented as two weekly meetings in the morning or in the afternoon, in classes of up to 25 students who have classes and workshops on two topics a day. 

The primary bottleneck for immediately scaling Pode Crer is money, the 2022 budget is $250k and the program runs two days a week with 300 students total. Because we are only able to hire the educators as part-time staff, we could readily double the capacity of the program if we had twice the money ($500k) and reach 600 students total.

In the current two-day-a-week format, a team of 4 educators working full-time could serve 400 students on each educational track. To offer the program 5 days a week to 400 students, a team of 8 educators would be required. Currently, the two biggest limitations for the Program are financial resources to hire the entire team as full-time staff (many can only be paid part time), and physical space for the program's activities. It is possible to double the reach of the program with the current team and twice the financial resources, with an yearly operating budget of R$2.4M (about 500k USD).

Student support scholarships ($40/mo)

Another challenge that we face is keeping students in class and getting some families to not pressure students to leave class to seek work, which is common with the vulnerable students from marginalized communities. Students on tracks 2 and 3 receive an allowance of R$200 (USD 40) per month during the program. This allowance is fundamental to incentivize them and their families to focus on studies rather than procuring work to supplement family income. 


Physical space and locations
The secondary bottleneck is location and physical space, getting to the classroom is challenging for many students, even with financial support for transport that we offer. Currently, Pode Crer is implemented in two locations due to the availability of spaces in two partner organizations and 3 educational tracks for ages 11-13 (track 1), 14-17 (track 2) and 18-24 (track 3). Tracks 2 and 3 are implemented in the city of Florianópolis and track 1 in the city of Palhoça. They serve very different communities and audiences, with different cultures. This creates a challenge for the consolidation of Pode Crer, as it is necessary to ensure coherence in the implementation of the program at each pole. But it also creates a huge opportunity for the developed methodology to be extremely robust. If all trails can be successfully implemented in two locations with distinct communities and cultures, this suggests that the implementation will be robust in new locations and cultures. 

To address the space and transport issues we want to build the first social innovation center in the heart of the community of Monte Serrat in Florianópolis where we have worked for many decades. It will provide high quality teaching spaces, technology labs, a library, makerspace, co-working space and socialization areas. As we expand the program we want to learn from this center to improve the design and implementation of the next ones. With more space and resources it will be possible to offer optional activities on the other 3 days of the week. Immediate possibilities that we would like to implement are focused workshops on technology, sports, culture, and to develop communication and leadership skills in smaller groups. 

Team growth
Finally, in order to truly scale, we will face the challenge of training and developing our team of educators. Currently we have hundreds of educators and staff in the organizations, and the 2022 implementation of Pode Crer supported by a team of 21 people, educators, social workers, pedagogues and administrators. We are very confident that we have the capacity to grow the team of educators by 50% each year, which would be sufficient to realize the vision of 125 centers with 12 educators and 8 support staff in each by 2033. We have the capacity to select good people, and train them in our educational approach, and to make them effective educators in the challenging contexts of Brazilian marginalized communities. What we need are a modicum of resources to make this vision happen even faster. If we receive $5M today in a few years we will have multiple centers operating and conclusive results to support further investment in 3-4 years.

The story of Vilson Groh
---------------------------------------------
Vilson Groh is a Catholic priest who in 1979 moved to the marginalized community of Monte Serrat in Florianópolis and devoted his life to enfranchising marginalized communities, using lifelong education and advocacy to bridge pervasive urban exclusion. This work continues today: now 68, living in the same place in Monte Serrat and still going strong, Vilson continues to use the respect, goodwill and convening power he earned over a lifetime of work dedicated to others to advance social justice through education and community.


Vilson was born and raised in Brusque, a city founded by German immigrants in 1860 in the state of Santa Catarina. He came to Florianópolis in 1978 to pursue graduate studies at the Federal University of Santa Catarina (UFSC). Soon after Vilson moved to the marginalized community of Monte Serrat in Florianópolis, which back then had no running water, sewage, paved roads, electricity or any kind of service. It was the quintessential favela, a Brazilian shantytown growing uphill without any kind of government oversight or regard, with rampant crime, violence and drug trafficking
 Vilson devoted his life to enfranchising marginalized communities, using lifelong education and advocacy to bridge pervasive urban exclusion, and this work continues today. For decades Vilson lived like the poorest, in a wooden hut, like most people around him. For that to change it took his mother demanding that he live with a modicum of dignity when many around him had brick and mortar houses, she refused to visit him for a year. He finally upscaled into a humble two bedroom brick and mortar house built by the community in that spot, where Vilson continues to live today. 
Every day Vilson uses the respect, goodwill and convening power he earned over a lifetime of work dedicated to others to advance social justice through education, community and helping literally everyone in need.


---------------------------------------------
The Vilson Groh Network
---------------------------------------------

Through Vilson Groh’s leadership and that of many others, small projects have flourished and became reference organizations in communities. As time went on other organizations joined the movement, and the Vilson Groh Institute was founded in 2011, to strengthen the actions of these organizations already under the leadership of Vilson Groh.
It should be highlighted that all of this work is performed in violent and marginalized communities in an extremely challenging educational context: students are initially violent, aloof, brute, emotionally undeveloped, and often going hungry. This network approach only works because every educator, volunteer and supporter is sensible and deeply aware of the realities in each community, and the Institute is extremely good at training educators. The network works through a holistic approach and engage with everyone involved: students, parents, families and the community, meeting social reality, constantly reassessing it and adjusting our approach.
Today the organizations that compose the Vilson Groh Network are:
== CEDEP (Center for Popular Education) - an experimental community educational organization created from scratch based on Paulo Freire’s philosophy complementary education for 600 youth and continuing education for adults
== AJPII (John Paul II association) - a school for children an and adolescent education where track 1 of Pode Crer is executed
== MESLM (Marist School Lucia Mayvorne) - free full time education for about 500 children and adolescents
== MESSJ (Marist School São José) - free full time education for about 1000 children and adolescents
== CCEA (Slave Anastácia Cultural Center) - cultural activities, support for children and youth, and tracks 2 and 3 of the Pode Crer program
== ACAM (Mocotó Hill Children Friends Association) - youth education and shelter for children and adolescents in vulnerable families
== AGB (Friends of Guinea-Bissau) - runs bilateral education programs for elementary and high school, as well as teacher trainings in Guinea-Bissau
== IVG (The Vilson Groh Institute itself) - runs university preparation program, the Pode Crer program, multiple family and community support programs

Personal Statement from Eduardo da Veiga Beltrame - https://munfred.com - eduardo@redeivg.org.br
I have been a very strong supporter of Pode Crer from the start, being in close contact with the Vilson Groh Institute leadership, and with over $120k donations of my own money (most of my wealth). I donated most of my would-be salary, money from a house sale in Brazil, and gave them computers, equipment, 3D printers and robotics kits. In 2022 I did a 5 week deep dive across all organizations of the Vilson Groh Institute, I talked to all the teachers, students, staff, community members, and spent a lot of time with the leaders of each organization.

I believe Pode Crer offers a template for the future of education in Brazil and Latin America. I am extremely confident in their exceptional institutional management and in their ability to operationalize programs and train and grow teams of educators.

6988,ASC Builder: A GUI development & deployment tool for Algorand smart contracts.,4,0x0,"ASC Builder is a GUI (drag-and-drop) smart contracts development software that enables one to add components and specify smart contracts behavior as well as logic with ease, and in turn aid in producing programmatic schematics which in turn could be transpiled to any smart contract development language such as Solidity, Pyteal etc.

ASC Builder's main operation depends solely on DOM element manipulation and attribute & data structure read/write, which encompasses the use of Nodes, methods and many other components that represent several functionality on a typical smart contract.

The system consists of Decisions, Subroutines, Conditionals, Arithmetic operations, etc. that the development process of smart contracts is centered upon. Upon completion of the schematic process of the GUI, the JSON attributes of the DOM elements that have been schematized are then parsed and structured into JSON objects which would serve as a middleman/intermediary interface through which the end results of the target smart contract programming languages are syntactically formed (in our case Pyteal). The schema can also be imported to another project when required for continued development.

Upon completion, the project can be deployed to MainNet, TestNet or BetaNet and even Sandbox through the use of third-party nodes such as AlgoExplorer, AlgoNode and PureStake.

Below is a link to the documentation:

https://ascbuilder-doc.readthedocs.io/en/latest

We have the solution currently in a private development environment, of which updates will be published frequently as they are made.

We have made it possible for developers (the community) to be able to submit templates on GitHub for review by the internal team; as well as internally created templates, which can be readily available on the platform and used by others.

The repository can be accessed via https://github.com/Algoknox/ASCBuilder_Templates.



We have a sample ASC Builder smart contract project in the image above that could in turn be compiled to the PyTEAL smart contract code result below or deployed to the Blockchain seamlessly:



We aim at revolutionizing the way in which smart contracts are being developed to make it easier for both developers and non-developers to create and deploy applications on the Algorand Blockchain, paving a way also for audits via the organization and/or third-party affiliates.

A lot of support is required from the ecosystem to make this solution a success and we look forward to hearing from the community and working on updates to provide our users with an easy as possible & intriguing user interface/experience for their work!

7177,ENS Latino Community D&I Initiative,4,0x336Ce087593688F431e3D9D57188Fa8Df10cF49B,"Problem/Issue: As active members of the ENS community and having the privilege of being fully bilingual (Spanish and English) we have identified that many times the Latino/Hispanic community had to participate in English-speaking spaces or communities in order to learn and obtain useful information even though they might not understand the language very much

Solution: Knowing that ENS had opened the keyboard for the Spanish language we saw an opportunity to create a community that focuses on giving a platform where latinos/hispanics can gather to learn, share information, and make connections in their native language meanwhile also promoting our heritage to other important communities in the ENS, Web3, and Crypto space in general.

Mission/Vision: Our vision is to support the ENS DAO directly in all matters regarding the Latin American and Spanish-speaking communities, to ensure that they are on the same playing-field as their English speaking colleagues.

To accomplish our vision, we have a set of mandates that we have set out to accomplish:

- Establish ENSLatino.eth as a decentralized, yet sovereign ENS DAO Delegate to help guide the ENS Latino community on DAO Governance.
- Organize and produce high-quality and broadcast friendly content that can be used across media channels like Youtube, Spotify Podcasts, Twitter Spaces, Tik Tok, etc. etc.
  -http://enslatino.medium.com/ - Destination for the translation of ENS DAO an other ENS ecosystem documents, blog posts, twitter rants and more!
  -http://enslatino.com/ - Web2 destination designed to bridge the SEO and visibility gaps by providing content transcription from other ENSLatino.eth sources, such as our Twitter Spaces, shows and relevant media. The page, independently run by community member DominiosWeb3.eth, also highlights active community members to help increase the visibility of their activity within the ENS Ecosystem.
  - **El.Buenos☀️Días.eth Show** - Daily morning show. Currently hosted a Twitter Space, it is our vision to evolve into a fully staffed, fully produced, on camera, live-event ready production.
     
       
  **En Arroz y Habichuelas** - Youtube channel hosted by @julioEAH, where he educates his viewers on financial literacy with the Latino American context, and contribute to the bridging of Spanish speaking community to the wonderful world of Web3, Blockchain, Crypto, and the emerging Metaverse.
   
  **🆘ocorro.eth** - Mutual Aid dApp concept to be designed and maintained by the ENSLatino community. The dApp will be designed around the core features of modern day crowd-funding with all the benefits of Web3.
   
  **Muchas🙏Gracias.eth** - A community rewards platform specifically designed for the Latino ENS community.

7239,LXDAO,4,0xC3d7F926e57Ff06e465823b100b95408e805DfA2,"LXDAO is an R&D-focused DAO in Web3. LX = 良心 = Conscience, which represents our Core Values: Buidl valuable things. Our missing is to bring together buidlers to buidl and maintain valuable Web3 projects in a sustainable manner.

How does LXDAO work? First, LX Buidlers post an idea in the community, and buidlers have discussions regarding it. It's like a brainstorming phase. After the idea matures, the LX buidler who is good at product management will start product design, and the project manager will start making a proposal (including dev resources, budgets, etc.) for it. Then the community will vote for it. Once approved, the project manager will start assembling a team from the community with the proper set of skills.  During development, the community will check the progress, and the project manager needs to write weekly for it.

We care about sustainability and effectiveness. Even for non-profit and public goods, LXDAO will apply for grants for the project team. And we are good at development, and our community and project management skills will ensure the project will be landed soon with high quality compared with the project made by individuals.


Our output or projects are not limited to a specific range, we buidl non-profit and profit projects (for DAO sustainability), and most of our projects are open-sourced. Here is our DAO GitHub https://github.com/lxdao-official. More projects will be open-sourced soon. We also make contributions to the whole Web3 industry. For example, our Mirror.xyz editing experience proposal just got approved (Proposal: https://forum.lxdao.io/t/proposal-mirror-xyz-editing-experience-improvement-project/139 ), we have addressed it is related to a Markdown Open Source project https://github.com/commonmark/commonmark.js/, and we have found one buidler working on it, make PR for this open source. 

We will use grants to keep improving LXDAO infra and smart contracts. And onboarding more and more LX Buidlers to work on projects together and push Web3 forward. Our latest update is open-sourced our SBT-based membership system code: https://github.com/lxdao-official/buidler-card-contracts, more coming.

7541,"BlockVersity, A DAO and NFT marketplace for online courses of all categories",4,0x1d2d08551144C5a7714563c2c500666996F30B30,"Our mission is to help course creators harness the economic benefits of WEB3. We bring hundreds of thousands of Web2 course creators, or normies, to web3 by providing them the opportunity to sell their courses using NFTs. 
Our marketplace will offer a broad range of courses, not just web3 education. BlockVersity also provides a much fairer compensation to course creators by giving them back ownership of their content and monetization terms. We could summarize BlockVersity as being Udemy meets Shopify and OpenSea.
To students, we offer verifiable non-transferable Proof of Skills
Our team seeks a grant to conduct further user research and to continue building our open-source MVP. 

Why is now a good time? 
E-learning had overtaken traditional learning, even before Covid, which accelerated the movement, and every year millions of people buy online courses.
NFTs are becoming mainstream users can even connect their wallets to Instagram and Facebook to post NFTs.
Many course creators are on Instagram and will soon get very excited about having their own NFTs to sell their courses; BlockVersity will give them this opportunity.

Initially, we will focus on on-demand online courses; however, BlockVersity sees a future where education ownership will gradually shift away from centralized institutions, allowing teachers and instructors to profit directly from their teaching. After all, IP is owned by teachers and instructors, not institutions.

As a DAO, BlockVersity plans to launch its own token for our community members to get a share of the marketplace and have a voice in its governance, another motivation for course creators to join BlockVersity.
BlockVersity is founded and led by women. We are a globally diverse team with members from across the USA, India, Nigeria, Australia, and New Zealand.

Why would web2 online course creators and their students move to web3?

The problem for Course Creators. On average, course creators selling online courses on Web2 marketplaces receive only 30%-35% of their sales; they don’t control the price and can’t connect with their students other than through the marketplace. Moreover, these marketplaces offer real community where creators can connect, share, and even co-create courses, at best, they offer forums.

Problem for Students
The web2 version of online education has been helpful for personal upskilling, but these skills are not seen as valuable to the employment marketplace. This is due to course certificates, when available, being non-verifiable and only recognizing course completion rather than proof of skills.

Solution/Product for Course Creators
BlockVersity is a DAO community that supports an NFT marketplace. 
BlockVersity aims to empower thousands of global Course Creators by giving them to keep the lion’s share of their sales and by providing a platform where they can build a strong community with other instructors and students.

Solution/Product for Students
The missing element from current online learning has been a lack of credible certification. When available, it is non-verifiable and recognizes course completion rather than proof of skills. Our platform will allow course creators to deliver Proof of Skills NFTs to solve this problem for all students.

We offer Vaulting as a Service to DeFi and Blockchain projects as well as users in order to help them maximize their liquidity and earnings. Crystl Finance is listed on the Crypto.com DeFi Wallet app and we have partnered with multiple large partners including ApeSwap and Relay Chain to provide Vaults and build liquidity.

We have released our own unique Vaulting and Yield Maximizing Strategies through our V3 Vaults and Ultra Farms which have been fully audited (link to audit: https://polycrystal.gitbook.io/polycrystal-finance/security/v3-vault-audit-by-hashex). With V3, we are able to stack multiple contracts on top of one another allowing for innovative and powerful yield maximization strategies. For example, we can create a strategy where you can stake USDC/USDT LPs and earn ETH/BTC that auto-compounds allowing users to DCA into blue-chip tokens without having to worry about impermanent loss.

We are also able to streamline the user experience with our Zap Functionality which allows users to go from a single token to an LP deposited in the Vault in one transaction. We can also “Boost” our Vaults with additional rewards in order to build greater liquidity and attract new users.

Our long-term vision of Crystl Cross-chain expansion and development comes in 3 phases (full presentation here https://www.beautiful.ai/player/-N2lG199RfAngm_3flmn/Crystl-Vision):

Phase 1: Novel Yield Integration

This comes in the form of our V3 Vaults and Ultra Farms which support and build DEXes and DeFi projects. Our novel code will give users numerous ways to invest as well as allow for smart contracts to be built on top of one another creating innovative chains for yield maximization and wealth management.

Phase 2: Cross-Chain Strategy

DAO Social
- The ultimate goal of DAOLink is to be the entrance of the metaverse. Nowadays, most of the so-called 'metaverse' service providers are just creating metaverse for online events. This is not a true metaverse. A true metaverse needs to have more solid user scenarios. It ought to give people reasons to come into the metaverse everyday. DAOs are definitely on the cutting edge of the metaverse. By gathering all DAOs together in DAOLink, we will be the first team to find out the real use cases of metaverse. That's why we think we have the potential to become the Web3 Facebook.

6930,milestoneBased,3,0x0,"If you were going to build your own house, would you give all the money to subcontractors in the first week? Most likely you would pay month by month to see how it goes and decrease your risks. So why is it not the same with VC funding where a startup gets awarded large funding round with a high probability they won’t make it and the investor loses it all?

The crypto company investing model is broken- riddled with the process and capital inefficiency and risk. Investor-founder collaboration is not systematic and characterized by inefficient capital and milestone management, and inexperienced founders learning to scale. milestoneBased is the first company to leverage a blockchain DAO and escrow smart contracts in an automated governance and funding collaboration platform. Early-stage investors use our platform for capital efficiency, to eliminate risk, improve transparency, and get more data-driven insights for a faster path to monetization of deployed funds. Startup teams are motivated and synchronized with investor expectations and more focused on the right KPIs for strengthened performance.

Started in 2018 by a team of blockchain and startup industry veterans, milestoneBased enables any early-stage startup to list company roadmap milestone goals, and connect and collaborate with crypto VC and Angel investors on the platform to provide funding. Funding decisions and governance are voted on as part of the DAO and funds are securely held in an escrow smart contract till milestones are verified and voted complete. The platform also offers a host of startup education tools and will introduce the tools for AI and performance analysis for investors.
 
We are developing a full-circle web3 platform where startups can be connected to investors and raise their funding and manage the roadmap efficiently. At the same time, investors can find their perfect portfolio fit, help the project as a value add-investor, and accelerate the path to their desired ROI. 
MilestoneBased as a solution is going to impact the whole crypto ecosystem influencing mass adoption by raising a level of trust to motivate teams as well as bring more investment players to the crypto company ecosystem, leaving such concepts as scam projects and fraud in the past. 

Our advantages:

Pipeline and portfolio management system for investors
Deal flow sharing module
Startup KYCs and ranking systems in future
The Roadmap library and memos feature as a knowledge-sharing hub for the community.
We operate on BSC which gives us higher TPS and at the same time our architecture allows us to adopt other chains in the future.
We have developed a set of Token utilities that benefit the constant growth of the token.
Our product is already working and having its first users on the platform
Over time we became a feature-rich platform almost an operating system for crypto VC
Enterprise-ready access level management
Viral features for self onboarding

6846,Daemons,3,0x0,"Ever wondered how it feels to be a blockchain power user? Do you have an awesome idea or strategy to combine different Dapps in order to maximize yields or capital efficiency?

Introducing Daemons, a platform that allows anyone to become an advanced blockchain user. Daemons can help you create blockchain-related actions tied to certain conditions (called Scripts). You can choose a set of actions, related to everyone’s favorite Dapps, and tie them to a condition. Your request is stored and when the condition is satisfied, the script will be retrieved and executed in an “If this, then that” fashion. All this, in a non-custodial, decentralized manner.

Does this look interesting to you?
daemons.fi is a community based protocol and needs your help to make it!

Why Daemons?
Before Daemons, users with no coding experience could not automate custom actions and had to make do with pre-built actions provided by the various platforms they used. This presents a certain amount of friction between non-technical users of DeFi and smart contract functionality. Platforms and contracts are not flexible, like all pieces of sophisticated software. It requires time and know-how, to prepare, debug, audit, and test a variety of smart contracts in order to automate the simplest of actions.

As such, Daemons was inspired. To remove the boundaries towards a decentralized and personalized finance management tool. Particularly, Daemons allows you to create personalized scripts to interact with your favorite DeFi platforms, in no time, with no programming knowledge, for free. DeFi should be enjoyed by everyone, not just software developers. Everyone should have the ability to create their own strategies and have them up and running instantly, without hassle or costs.

Some basic examples possible:

Perform a DCA, buying tokens every week.
Take profit/stop loss whenever the price of an asset is greater than X.
Exit from a high-risk LP pool, removing 10% of the liquidity every 5 hours.
Swap some tokens each time your balance is greater than 0.

Daemons gives multiple primitives that can be mixed and matched to create personalized scripts that can fit any need.

How does it work?

The execution flow always follows these steps:

7319,The World Largest Blockchain Job Freelancing Platform,3,0x99D3902df24797b0639280C3FA84188A08811dDf,"

Newsmartjob: Every freelancer’s go-to website! 

We, Divine pandas are a team of the app and web experts whose only goal is to improve client productivity and business strength by providing affordable and effective marketing solutions. Founder Divya Jyoti Sen and co-founder Jade Lai-ting li started a team of 22 web experts with over 12 years of experience that can provide the best website design, development, and marketing services to grow their client’s business online. Recently we have launched a new platform called Newsmartjob to provide opportunities and freelancing gigs to job seekers in the blockchain industry. Ours is the only blockchain smart contract freelance platform to ever exist. 

Smart contracts are digital contracts that work on certain terms and conditions to make sure whether an agreement is automatically executed or not. Official contracts like these are necessary to satisfy the freelancers and the clients that their payment and task will be completed satisfactorily.As a freelancer, it’s very important to have trust and transparency with your clients. Because that is the foundation of any successful business. There are numerous platforms out there that help freelancers get good gigs and consistent work. But when it comes to payment, their process is either too slow or clients back out at the last moment.Whatever the reason, freelancers have to suffer in the end. They are overworked and denied their reward, whether intentionally or unintentionally. But this doesn’t happen with Newsmartjob because we use smart contracts like MetaMask to avoid any kind of payment delay. Interestingly, we are the only ones to have this system as of now. MetaMask is a kind of smart contract or a cryptocurrency wallet that singlehandedly works on both desktop and mobile devices. It is popular because of its ability to buy, send and receive cryptocurrency from within the wallet. Smart contracts provide this level of security and safety among job seekers to maintain their trust. With the presence of these digital contracts, it becomes easier for freelancers to provide great value to their clients without any second thoughts. Newsmartjob accepts everyone around the globe to be a part of their platform and earn a consistent income through it. With emerging advanced technologies like these, people can trust freelancing as a legit carrier choice. 

Just like other jobs, freelancing has its pros and cons but one of its biggest drawbacks was denied payment. Nobody likes losing their hard-earned money. Newsmartjobs understands this pain and agony and their smart contracts act as a painkiller for the same.

7368,beoble - Pluggable Modular Web3 Social Layer,3,0xcC847f25746Aee67bA796E26D108AF44D0DA4173,"beoble is a social module with API and SDK for Web 3.0. 
It is an on-chain based communication window and a user-owned Web 3.0 product. With beoble, Web 3.0 services can easily integrate social functionalities of social profile, messaging, and posting & feeds into their services in 5 minutes. 

With DeFi summer in 2020 and NFT boom in 2021, Web 3.0 has begun to gain huge attention and users, yet there is not much place for users to communicate using on-chain data on Web 3.0. Many Web 3.0 services including DEX, P2E games and NFT projects are looking into adding social features, but it is costly to build and not compatible with other services. Meanwhile, existing Web 2.0 social services lack support for blockchain and Web 3.0. beoble aims to address those problems by providing social modules.

beoble’s core features include 
1) modularized social profile, 
2) modularized wallet-to-wallet messaging, and 
3) modularized posting & feeds (Can think of improved Bitmex trollbox for native Dapps)

We offer seamless integration with any native dapps with our API/SDK modules with the following benefits
- effortless UI integration with our API/SDK modules with native social features and improved user experience
- adds in-app organic engagement to native dapps which improves user retention

As per our development status, we're done with native client and is finalizing the API/SDKs as we plan to launch on June with few native Dapps already lined up as launch partners for integration.

6966,Blockchain based Searh Engine,2,0x0,"I’ll start from why? Well there’s just too much scam around internet.

I would like to create an NFT gated portal, for website as well as any blog, channel owners or researchers, people who don’t want scammy ads and appreciate only useful search results.

There will be 4 kind of NFT accesses to start,
one where people will be able to acquire access to search engine, no ads
second for name NFT owners
third and fourth with access to both. One of them is not to be sold, is made for you; who is here from start and invested.

Firstly the name:
Potentially minted to NFT with reflecting username/business/website address, including the public website some tags, included in our DAO, which will have a power of voting to allow people to remove address from the engine to prevent any scam.

Secondly the search engine:
Build initially searching through the minted NFTs, not marked as spam in the contract, of course with goal to be as intuitive as giants search engines.

I would be looking to lunch some scheme for legitimate content, where individuals with truly fantastic impact on society, would be able to claim their name in engine free, proving access to their website/channel.

You will ask, what about ads? Well, this depends but one I know, surely not for NFT members, I didn’t plant it in full yet, potentially the non NFT version of engine would contain some ads, which profit from would be used to continue to growth the project, fund necessary infrastructure around it and share part with NFT members who has access to engine? Definitely transparency is what I demand for my community, as much, as for this to be proper 21st dApp, so during the growth, there will be a lot of chances to vote and decide about the project!

About me? I’m just a full stack dev with thousands of ideas, for improvements for the of community, for past 12 years freelancing web development, working in IT infrastructure full time, now since web3 is new, the hype, I’ve spent past 6 months of all my free time, on updating myself, studying blockchain development. I look to publish many ideas in the crypto world and see if they will be seen, if others see as me, that we can still focus on building this world better, rather than mars.

Hope this project finds you well, I’m thinking of few names for it, so I won’t be disclosing them yet, maybe we will do some voting for initial investors to choose/propose the name? I want community to decide, not some big corpos. Attached link will include startup page as well as project visualisation in the upcoming weeks to prepare for next GIT round.

7393,BanklessDAO Projects,2,0xf26d1Bb347a59F6C283C53156519cC1B1ABacA51,"BanklessDAO Gitcoin Grant Proposal

THE BANKLESSDAO MISSION...

BanklessDAO is a decentralised community coordinating and propagating bankless media, culture, and education. BanklessDAO launched on May 4, 2021, and its goal is to drive adoption and awareness of truly bankless money systems like Ethereum, DeFi, and Bitcoin.
Together, the BanklessDAO community collaborates to create user-friendly onramps for people to discover decentralised financial technologies through education, media and culture.
The BanklessDAO community runs a variety of projects; for the scope of this grant we are focusing on the ones which truly provide goods and services for the entire world such as BANKLESS ACADEMY, BANKLESS AFRICA, BANKLESS RESEARCH and INTERNATIONAL MEDIA NODES. 
The projects listed below have had contributors working on them for many months and although some of the project contributors earn governance tokens, the work being done far outstrips the existing remuneration. Second, and perhaps more important, is that all these projects aim to help the wider crypto ecosystem and not just the Bankless community — and hence are public goods.


BANKLESS ACADEMY

🚀 Brief
Bankless Academy is a leading web3 ""knowledge on-ramp"" - a practical & engaging education experience with infrastructure preparing to be scaled across the blockchain multiverse.
We're helping the world adopt the permissionless tools they need to go Bankless.

🔥 Vision
We are building a web3 world where:
📚 Information is frictionless and free.
👊 Communities are high impact creators.
🌐 Education is permissionless (no central body dictates what you can/can't see).

🗺️ Trajectory
Current focuses:
Establish a Bankless-native syllabus/user journey to move users from Centralised Exchanges to Ethereum Layer2 self-custody.
Pursue collaboration with popular dApps to educate users on trusted tools available to them.
Build theory lessons with expert guests from the Bankless 'Hall of Fame'.
Form frontier partnerships so that the Academy dApp continues to support interoperability and cutting-edge use cases.
Continue research, development, and onboarding for our whitelabel platform to scale our efforts into other web3 ecosystems.
Build a framework for contributor content creation to empower talented community educators.

🌏 Let's scale permissionless education together!


BANKLESS AFRICA
Our community is focused on promoting the bDAO mission. We leverage crypto-based creations like Bitcoin, Defi, NFTs etc. to tackle problems faced by Africans.

Achievement/Growth:
*Our podcast highlights projects and people making impact in the African crypto/Web3 ecosystem.
*Our Newsletter provides well curated information on Bitcoin, DeFi, crypto regulations, projects and Web3 funding in the crypto/Web3 space in Africa.
*Our website helps Africans access educational courses. It includes a link to Bankless Academy where lots of Web3 courses are available. Eventually this website will become a native-educational platform for Africans.
Website v1 here: https://banklessafrica.com/
*We onboard and train contributors with various Web3 ethos, teaching them how to contribute in various DAOs and potentially bootstrap project ideas they have.
Some links to get into our community: https://linktr.ee/banklessafrica.


BANKLESS RESEARCH


Bankless Research provides in-depth, rigorous and investigative insights into web3 topics across the board, thereby being able to draw on a wide web of contacts within the space. While our special focus lies on DeFi and governance issues, we are happy to also cover any other topic of interest to our clients. Due to our experience we have been able to develop successful formats to address the most sought after requests, thereby retaining the flexibility to tend to specialists’ requests, requirements and ancillary services individually.

Notable achievements:
In cooperation with the BC Grants Team, we managed to secure a grant from TribeDAO to develop a research report for them. The result was a 45-page long breakdown of the TribeDAO ecosystem. Saddle Finance was the second Web3 project for whom Bankless Research has conducted research for. We have also started reaching out to potential partners, who are aligned with BanklessDAO mission, and with whom we will form strategic partnerships based on our objectives.

Current situation in the market:
Web2 companies currently profit twofold: by charging readers a monthly/yearly subscription granting access to research reports which these companies receive grants for to write. Problem is this research often barely scratches the surface of the projects, contains outdated information and is published before showing the content to the client. 
 
Our solution:
Bankless Research aims to solve these problems by: 
✔️ Forming a team of subject matter experts with experience in web3. 
✔️ Utilizing the procured team of experts to conduct professional research. 
✔️ Collecting trusted resources for analytics data. 
✔️Applying qualitative and quantitative analysis to deepen the understanding of a project. 
✔️ Establishing and maintaining a deep connection with the client/grant donor, enabling the facilitation and collection of feedback after the final report is ready to be published. 

Use of funds:
Funds received in GR15 will directly support operations within Bankless Research, including bounties for research work.
We are planning to build a website to help us onboard clients and researchers as well as facilitating the exchange between all parties and providing access to educational material.
Further the continuous expansion of our tooling repertoire will be supported.
Finally we will explore and use different channels to help market our services and products to a wider audience to achieve a healthy, long term growth trajectory.


🌏 INTERNATIONAL MEDIA NODES (IMN)
Only 5% of the world’s population are native English speakers and roughly 15% speak English on some level. The initial goal of the IMN project is to reach the remaining 80% by translating and distributing content about blockchain technology, DeFi, the Metaverse and Web3. All links: https://www.banklessimn.xyz/
The International Media Nodes project believes in the liberating effect of going Bankless and what it can do for improving financial wellbeing and stability throughout the world. Creating and maintaining communities of people who do not speak English and educating them/opening the door for them to onboard to Web3 is one of the most crucial pieces of infrastructure if we want Web3 to be any different from Web2.

The story so far…
In Q1 2022, the total audience grew by 52% as compared to the previous quarter and our total reach is over 40,000 audience members in over 20 languages. We have more than 100 active contributors speaking 20 different languages from all parts of the world. We have worked with prominent DAOs in Web3 such as Polygon, Tribe and Yearn.
Over the next months and years, as we continue to produce content we will also start developing local language communities which will develop Web3 talent in local languages as well as organising events in different geographical locations to onboard more people.

Our Ask to the Crypto Community ...
At the highest level, the Web3 education provided by BanklessDAO stands to empower humanity with the informed decision-making required in our digital future. We firmly believe that we align with the vision of the Gitcoin Community, and that together we can work to slay Moloch.
We seriously can’t wait to show you what we have to offer this space.
Let’s Impact Together!
BanklessDAO believes in the liberating effects of going Bankless and the impact our ideal can have on improving the financial stability and wellbeing of our world, both in learning and translation. With the help of the Gitcoin Community, we will accelerate the spread of an ungated Web3 education for everyone.

Writing a comprehensive scientific report would require intense concentration in yourself. You could manage that if only it came as an experience. Today, individuals get committed to obligations that consume most of their time. As such, it becomes difficult for them to balance schoolwork and social life.

Steps in Writing a Scientific Researcher Paper

Academic essay writing should be an easy task for any student. But is that the case nowadays? Often, scholars fail to deliver the recommended reports for Their assignments from expertpaperwriter.com/writemyessaytoday-review/. It is crucial to find an assistant to guide you in managing your papers. Luckily enough, online sources have tools that will allow one to detect a qualified writer to handle tasks for clients.

Now, what is the use of nitrite in academic documents? Besides, is there a harm in picking a subject that might impede performance?

After evaluating the provided instructions, students who don't know how to craft a reporting process are often afraid of using a particular reference. In schools, we are facing challenges here and There. Every individual must develop a ways of surviving these situations. And why is that so?

First, try to understand the prompts in the literature. From there, learn the necessary styles to apply and the structure to include in thereports. Remember, nobody wants to present an inappropriate document that won't earn better scores. If it is for a practical reason, others will also shun away from the same experiment.

Also, it is vital to plan well while handling the project. proper planning allows you to have all the materials at hand. For instance, you’ll have a chemistry lab notebook that will be useful when experimenting with various protein compounds. The good thing is that you’ll have theisites needed to tackle the requests. Moreover, some supervisors provide bonuses for professional services. With that, anyone in a position to benefit from assistance from an expert practitioner will outshine even the low-class client in terms of standard times.

7590,Atmos Protocol Grant Request,2,0x0,"Lead-in
Atmos is an entirely decentralized, open-source, permissionless protocol that operates on the Aurora chain. The protocol aims to provide an automated stablecoin mechanism, with minimization of control and human influence, which brings decentralized and algorithmic money to the entire space of the blockchain.

Atmos includes 2 tokens in the protocol ecosystem: Atmos token ""ATM"" and Atmos stablecoin ""aUSD"".

The protocol design distinguishes the following features:

Fractional-Algorithmic Model

aUSD - an automated, fractional-algorithmic token with a floating/unbacked supply, meaning that the part of the supply is backed by the collateral and a part stays algorithmic. Atmos Protocol issues aUSD, which attempts to target a particular price index ($1 value), using a targeting mechanism. If aUSD is trading at above $1, the protocol decreases the collateral ratio. If aUSD is trading at under $1, the protocol increases the collateral ratio. More references:

https://www.stakingrewards.com/journal/can-an-algorithmic-stablecoin-survive/
https://vitalik.eth.limo/general/2022/05/25/stable.html

On-chain Oracles

Atmos uses dynamic TWAP (time-weighted average prices) and on-chain oracles.

Dual Tokenomics

aUSD is partially backed by the ATM - a share token of the Atmos protocol, which endows holders with the following utilities: governance, revenue sharing, fee accumulation, and yielding rewards.

Minimized Governance

As long as aUSD offers a highly autonomous, algorithmic approach with no active management, having bugs or governance vulnerabilities.

Flux Protocol - a cross-chain oracle providing smart contracts with economically secure data. Since Atmos is an autonomous protocol that delivers stablecoin with the fractional-algorithmic model as a product, we need to get the reliable and correct price data feed.
Router Protocol - an infrastructure for cross-chain communication. Atmos Protocol will integrate Router's Widget to give our users an option to perform cross-chain transactions directly from Atmos dApp’s UI.
Aurigami - a decentralized, non-custodial lending protocol. Atmos AMO — Automated Market Operation will automatically deposit up to 85% of idle USDC collateral into Aurigami's USDC lending pool.
Trisolaris - № 1 DEX on the NEAR's Aurora EVM. Atmos Protocol will deploy main liquidity pairs on the Trisolaris DEX at the launch. The liquidity mining event will be available via Trisolaris pools from day 1!

Those strategic cooperations will confidently lead Atmos Protocol to the MVP release with the all-needed functionality and recognition among other protocols in the entire Aurora blockchain space.

$ATM Token Economy
All the utility in the Atmos Protocol is concentrated in Atmos (ATM) token. ATM - is the governance token in the Atmos ecosystem which plays a significant role in the protocol autonomous operation:



The supply of ATM is originally fixed at 100 million tokens at genesis, however, the number in circulation is anticipated to be deflationary as aUSD is minted at increasing algorithmic ratios. The protocol is designed in such a way that ATM supply would be primarily deflationary as long as aUSD demand will grow.

ATM Distribution
The greater amount of tokens will be distributed into the market through the liquidity mining program and will reward liquidity providers for their contribution.

The total ATM supply - 100,000,000 units.

Community (75%)
75,000,000 ATM will be distributed among various liquidity mining programs / farming / staking. The ATM emission is not set at a fixed rate for the whole distribution period and it can be changed by adjusting new rates through the governance proposals.

Public Offering (10%)*
10,000,000 ATM are reserved for the public sale event which will be held before the protocol launch. Distribution has a design of linear vesting terms.

Treasury (15%)
15,000,000 ATM are reserved for the Treasury. Distribution has a design of linear vesting terms. The aim of this allocation lies in the following needs:

Security Bug Bounties
Partnerships
Marketing
Community Grants

We are in touch with NearStarter and NearPad concerning the $ATM token launch.

Grant Request

The requested amount: $30,000

The purposes of the grant:

Marketing strategies and further community building-up
at least 1 audit report from the leading blockchain security firm
wages payments

Thank you for your time, waiting for you on the protocol launch!

7212,ERC-Cool - The new standard in climate action,2,0x3196AA0F31dFc8CaD40Dc92C418b8Af5e7ccAD65,"The 'ERC-Cool' is an improved implementation on the Ethereum standard smart contract ERC721A, that uniquely weaves real world perpetual carbon capture to any NFT use case that adopts it. It is an open source - planet cooling - super sustainable - delight. A digital public good intended to be adopted and sprinkled to every corner of the internet. 

While the impact happens out there, the carbon that is removed stacks up inside the NFT, to create an additional layer of value that grows with each and every trade, to for the first time create climate action for the ownership era. 

This is impact that, once started, cannot be stopped. Immutable and perpetual. These are NFT's embedded with carbon removal to create a scalable, collective, powerful tool to combat climate change.


Programmed to cool.
Inspired by the likes of the Curious Addys, MetaAngels and the Azuki Community with their ERC721A innovation, we wanted to push the space further and improve on the standard iteration - to not only allow the crypto community to solve pain points but also solve the greatest challenge of our time and collectively fight climate change with each and every NFT. 

The ERC-Cool smart contract features functions that purchase carbon removals at the prevailing market rate, then add that carbon back to the NFT. The result is, NFTs laced with real world carbon removal and an additional layer of value.



Giving carbon removal a bold assist.
The Earth’s biosphere, unaided, cannot fix the climate problem. In other words, nature was never designed to cope with a 170-year all-you-can-eat oil & gas buffet. 

Focussing on reducing emissions is no longer enough, we must simultaneously work to remove carbon dioxide (CO2) from the atmosphere - and do so as permanently as possible. This is no longer a last resort, it's an urgent necessity. 

If humanity is to survive the climate emergency we have to scale the carbon removal from todays tons, to gigaton scale within the next decade. Scientists estimate we need to permanently remove as much as 6 gigatons of CO2 per year by 2030, and 10 gigatons per year by 2050... yet in 2021, we removed just 10,000 tons. 

Carbon removal requires a bold assist. We need to scale radical tech innovation - beyond reducing carbon emissions, beyond the solutions we already have in our toolkit to increase the likelihood the world has the portfolio of solutions it needs to tackle the task at hand. 

TL;DR
We have to figure out how to hit Ctrl+Z on decades worth of carbon pollution - ASAP.



Now for some good news.
Much of the technologies we need to tackle this has already begun to be developed. They're just early, more expensive and therefore underfunded and underutilized. Unless we step in, these solutions will be left on the shelf. instead of playing a critical part of the solution. The ERC-Cool will direct funds to accelerate carbon removal in order to cool the planet now and into the future.



How we're getting it done:
STEP ONE - The ERC-Cool contains withdraw and royalties functions, that auto-trigger the purchase of high quality Carbon Removal credits upon minting or transaction. In partnership with Patch it will direct critical funds to removals technologies in order to create demand and grow future supply, and provide the world a better chance having the portfolio of solutions we require. 

STEP TWO - The Carbon Removal credits are then bridged on chain and locked into our carbon pool. This is a one-way bridge: carbon credits can be brought on-chain but can't go the other way. The reason for that is simple: to prevent double-counting and lock them away for permanent impact. 

STEP THREE - We then tokenize and fractionalize the carbon removal credits via our $CXXL token. A carbon reference token backed by real world carbon removal, where 1 $CXXL = 1 KG of carbon removed.

STEP FOUR - Finally we embed the amount of $CXXL generated back into the initiating NFT via dynamic metadata. The more ERC-Cool NFTs are sold and traded - the more carbon removed. With each transaction increasing the fundamental value of the NFT itself.


Cooling the planet isn't a spectator sport.
To tackle climate change, we need mass coordination and action at scale. We need everyone to take every opportunity  possible to make an impact. We are the ones we've been waiting for. With the innovations in Web3 that radically reducing barriers to coordination between individuals and groups, decentralizing influence, authority and productivity in unprecedented ways, we can finally take action into our own hands. The ERC-Cool is a tool for collective action, able to scale to something bigger than any individual action. 

If adopted as the new standard, the ERC-Cool will unlock a scale of action never seen before, out-funding the carbon removal efforts of the likes Stripe, Shopify, Alphabet, Meta, McKinsey and Elon (X-Prize) - put together. This is action for the people, by the people. So let's cool this mighty fine planet together.



All roads lead to cool.
The ERC-Cool is currently in the R&D phase of development. 

We anticipate being able to release the standard in October with The world's first 'mint of intent'. Like a letter of intent in web2, but cooler. This is a free mint, a collective proof of concept and social signal of intent to do web3 differently.

Then to see the year out and with money in the company slush fund from the fine folk at the Solana Foundation, we will move to cool those on the Sol train and onboard web2 in partnership with Shopify. 

And that's just for starters.

7017,Urgent Help Needed to Rebuild Storm-Damaged School,2,0x0,"On March 14, 2022, an intense storm tore the roof off the Spectrum High School building in Kagoma village, part of the Kyangwali Refugee Settlement in Uganda. The teachers inside when the roof came off were able to seek shelter in a nearby church. Fortunately, no students were in the building at the time. The schoolhouse suffered major damage severely compromising its structural integrity. Many other buildings in the village were also destroyed, and this is the only school in the area. The students and teachers have nowhere to hold classes until it is rebuilt. We here at Ensō Education Institute are scrambling to help our partner school get up and running again as soon as possible. They need $9000 to rebuild Spectrum with stronger materials that will withstand the next storm and to replace books, teaching materials, and school supplies destroyed by the rain and wind.
 
We know that there are many just causes to support these days, so on behalf of the students and teachers of Spectrum High School, we thank you so much for your consideration and ask that you share this campaign with your friends and colleagues. Please know that a donation of any size would be a tremendous help!",Invalid Ethereum Address. 
7014,Build Decentralised Science Laboratories in the Metaverse,2,0x0,"Our aim is to create an ecosystem where scientists are incentivized in cryptocurrency to openly share longevity related research and receive credit for their work while allowing anyone to access and contribute to the research easily.

Our DeSci ecosystem will include investors seeking for investment opportunities in the longevity field. This will convert research works into real world solutions.

By creating a virtual, immersive and persistent scientific environment, we will facilitate meaningful human interactions between scientists and funders while eliminating a centralised control. 
Funders will have a pool of research work to choose from while scientist will have the right funding to convert ideas to solutions.
MERITS OF DECENTRALISED SCIENCE OVER TRADITIONAL SCIENCE: 

1) Scientists collaborate with peers from all over the globe in dynamic teams. Unlike traditional scientific research where centralised organisations limit collaborations. 

2) Scientists will be able to share virtual laboratory services with anyone in the world. This is unlike traditional science where sharing is limited. 

3) Scientists will earn rewards in Transhuman Coin (our native token) for peer-reviewing work. This is not the case with traditional scientific where peer-review works are unpaid. 

4) Sharing all of the research procedure, including the data from unsuccessful efforts, by having all steps on-chain. This is different from the traditional publication bias which makes researchers more likely to share experiments that had successful results. 

We are seeking for funding to commence development of the Transhumanist DeSci project which will bring the longevity field closer to blockchain.

This project is also a very good tool for onboarding friends into Web3:
Without MyFirstNFT:
spend a lot of time explaining the concepts and knowledge to your friends;
you might miss some key points, like security, lack of security knowledge can lead to theft of property;
You need to help them install the wallet on their browser, etc.
With MyFirstNFT:
Send the MyFirstNFT website link(myfirstnft.info) to them, and answer some questions, if any, done.

Our goal is to assist more Web3 enthusiasts in easily understanding and learning Web3 concepts and knowledge, allowing them to enter the Web3 world quickly and safely.

This project was started by Bruce and built by the LXDAO community for almost two months. We have 17 core contributors and over 30 contributors who brought excellent ideas, feedback, and suggestions. And everyone can discuss the content in our forum (https://forum.lxdao.io/c/projects/001-mfnft/14) and contribute to ensuring the content is updated and cover most of the key points.

Why did we embark on this project? Because many newcomers to Web3 are confused and helpless, there are too many concepts and knowledge to learn and the risk of theft if not done correctly. There are many tutorials and documents on the market, but they are not very systematic and must be summarised and organized by themselves, and many concepts are difficult to understand, so we thought, why not create a comprehensive tutorial that is simple to understand? In addition to concepts, we have security knowledge, which is very important in the Web3 world, we also provide how to DYOR section, and we also provide a free mint NFT function, so the combination of theory and practice can help newbies enter the Web3 world faster.

We would like to apply for grants to continue optimizing and promoting this project, such as adding more languages, improving the interactive experience (especially the mobile version), and optimizing the content to make it more understandable, in the hopes of assisting more people who are interested in Web3.

We are also planning to make the second version of this project in the community. The topic is on our community forum https://forum.lxdao.io/t/the-next-version-of-myfirstnft/66.

7384,Ourlog: Multiplayer Thinking for Working Groups,2,0x4f2bc5641C2e7EAeA0eD19824fc0D4479817432D,"Overview
Ourlog is a decentralized communication tool for communities to log their research, thinking, and insights in a collective environment for the purposes of publishing. From scientific research, to government, to social groups, to web3 builders, Ourlog is a public, networked goods tool for any team to cohere and publish its collective intelligence. It’s like Discord plus Wordpress for web3.

As a comms tool, Ourlog:
facilitates deep qualitative exploration of personal and collective information
supports distributed groups in finding coherence across complex topics
pipelines content from a private group environment to publish to the broader public

Built in the Ethereum ecosystem, Ourlog is based on blocks as a primitive media component. Block content affords the ability to easily respond to, extend, challenge, curate, and develop your personal and collective thinking over time. Relationships between blocks are defined through a simple protocol, providing queryable context for your group’s thinking.

We are committed to developing Ethereum’s communications infrastructure, as we believe this to be a fundamental aspect of Ethereum’s continued growth as a healthy, democratic system. Our focus is the development of public, networked communications goods.

The Need for Ourlog
After building several projects in the Ethereum ecosystem, our team found it difficult to sustain ongoing efforts across multiple projects (see details below: Relational Projects). We worked best when we were together, physically, and wanted to bring the high quality in-person experience to our distributed team.

Building on a shared practice of journaling in the mornings, we began an experiment using Discord as an Ourlog prototype. In a Discord server, each member has a channel to use as their personal research log and everyone on the team is welcome to read and tag messages to send them to a shared stream.

From the shared stream, we bubble up highlights to publish as a way to capture our thinking at a point in time. In this way, Ourlog serves as a method to support self-organized group journalism. Currently, we’re going for minimal editing, sharing our thinking in more-or-less the same form as it was posted to Discord. We publish our thinking based on Ourlog entries on Mirror: https://mirror.xyz/0xb1CfC8e818fC40dB33F59caaeFe29B3FFc6aF65A

Current Build Status
While enacting a prototype of Ourlog in Discord and publishing our thinking on Mirror, we’re also building an iOS dapp on the Polygon network and are working towards a full web dapp. We’re in the early stages of the build—everything we’re sharing here is prototype and articulates our directional thinking for the tool.

Currently, the vision is for an iOS/MacOS app with the following features:
a simple capture utility to provide a focused place to write, think, create, explore ideas
seamless web3 experience on native applications
simple responding to other’s posts
tagging capability for posts
composable query system for personalized viewports


iOS and MacOS dapp prototypes - capture surface; web dapp prototype - shared team stream

Some of the high-level technical achievements to-date include:
deployed a number of Polygon smart contracts for basic Ourlog functionality: logging, commenting, tagging (these are the basis for the rlog protocol)
indexed and built an arbitrary relationship system using TheGraph
built a novel implementation of smart contract wallets to enable seamless user experience iOS


rlog smart contract wallet flow

Ourlog aims for a simple, out-of-the-box experience for technical and non-technical people alike. Ourlog’s codebase is open source, so others can fork and customize it to fit their team’s needs. In creating Ourlog, we’re emerging a protocol for developers to build their own logging dapps. This emerging protocol (which we call research log, or rlog) is open source and in active development: https://github.com/relational-os/rlog

Funding
Gitcoin funds will be used to continue building the Ourlog dapps as well as the rlog protocol specification. Specifically, money will flow to:
Our team in compensation for time spent on design and development contributions
Creating and launching a bounty program to expand and fund additional contributors on Ourlog
Collaboration tooling and infrastructure costs (Zoom, Notion, Infura, Vercel, Figma)
Polygon contract deployment and meta-transaction fees

Who is building Ourlog?
Ourlog is a Relational project. Relational is an open media and communications collective, currently comprised of six founding members: Kristen Pavle, Dave Gorum, CJ Pais, Jon Borichevskiy, Tony Llongueras, and Jordan McCommons. 

We’ve been building in the web3 space for almost 2 years; you can learn more about us, and what we’ve been up to, including past decentralized publishing experiments, here: https://buzzard.life.

Relational’s vision is a decentralized human communication layer built in the Ethereum ecosystem. We take advantage of EVMs natively networked, naturally interconnected data environment to allow for communication to flow democratically. Whether you’re communicating through words, pixel art, or game experience points, Relational is interested in supporting your work.

One of Relational’s core values is “Community is a Verb”—we’re organized around shared practices and routines. Ourlog is one of the core tools we’re building to underpin our work as a community of practice.

The library takes these two things and simplifies access to them.  This would make it usedful for NFT gallery apps, games which use NFTs, ethereum apps and many other things.

On mobile devices (phones, tablets, etc) it is hard to get access to a users NFTs as dApps usually live in the browser and not as actual apps.  

It currently has two main purposes.  
1 - Get the users Eth address from the Metamask Mobile app.  
2 - Get a list of Assets (NFTs) associated with that address.  These are proper objects and it can currently  tell the difference between picture, audio and video NFTs.  Others (BAYC, etc) could be added.

As Metamask is a bit unpredictable, I now use their upcoming SDK for allowing my app to talk to their app.  This involves refactoring some of their code which I hope to give back to them.

6986,Plantiverse - Building an Interspecies Economy,2,0x0,"
Why are we building an Interspecies Economy?  Because we need to move away from a human-centric economy where resources are used in favor of humans, to a planetary-centric economy that is regenerative by incorporating all stakeholders, human and non-human.

Our project Plantiverse started out with an exploration of rights for plants, by giving them autonomy. Building on the Rights of Nature movement's gains of independent legal standing for forests and species, we wanted to see if we could get operational, financial, and maybe even civil rights for non-human living beings.

We gave Herbie (a herb houseplant) a form of their own autonomy, letting them make certain decisions on their own.  Sensors measure Herbie's light, soil moisture, water reservoir, humidity and temperature; which are linked to decisions about mobility; so that Herbie, when in need of water or light, will go to the water source / light source. 


 
As Herbie gained decision making power over mobility, we asked ourselves, can non-human beings have economic power?  What if Herbie could deliver and sell their own herbs and leaves to people?  And if Herbie can sell and “earn” money, could Herbie have a bank account?  Could Herbie own things, vote, or even have planetary citizenship?
 
But how would that manifest in the real world? 

So we went to work with Herbie, in fact we enabled a family of plants, Minty, Ivy, Ginger and other plants, with sensors.  These sensors, in turn, give readings that are then paired with a particular output of an image,  Leave colors, for example, indicate water level, ….

The rendering, then, becomes a visualization of physiological status of the plant itself, essentially a digital twin, or avatar, of the plant in real life.

These visualizations, then were minted in the carbon neutral Solana chain and sold as NFTs or NFTrees.  The funds raised via the sales will be directed to sustainable causes.  



For millennia, humans have dominated the earth, and dominated species, “domesticating” plants and animals, and claimed ownership to nature and its resources.
 
As the consequences of our human centricity impact the earth, what if it is time for non-humans to gain autonomy, and even rights, on par with humans? 

This project is about using metaverse, NFT and digital twins as a mechanism for non-humans to gain equal rights so that we can truly establish a fully integrated and diverse approach to earth stewardship, an interspecies metaverse.

We think that this is just the beginning and one of a possible self-governed equitable models for a true equitable ecosystem for our planet that is inclusive.  Digital twins allow for non-human to have a presence, rights and even economic means in the metaverse that is immutable and traceable.  

Our unsustainable model of capitalism that is over sourcing our natural resources need to be reinvented.   It is time we rethink capitalism, and one of the ways we can level out the playing field is to give plants and other non-human species the same economic power and decision making capabilities that are to their benefits, not ours.

Interspecies economics might be a means to a more equitable planet, by incorporating all aspects of the complexity of planetary accounting into our consumption model in order to understand how to create a regenerative economy.

We are currently planning to create the world’s first plant-governed DAO so that plants themselves will have the ability to decide how the funds of these NFTrees should be spent.  If the water level is low, then the funds will then go towards water focused initiatives, for example.

After this first iteration of NFTrees, we are now working on the 2nd generation of NFTrees where the trees are now generated in 3D and can be “planted” via geolocation in the place of your choice and can be viewed via our own augmented reality application of SOFT (Store of Future Things) app.  



In our future pipeline, we are hoping to extend this project and place sensors in the forest in the same capacity to monitor forestry health and convert those as NFTrees as well.  Other initiatives, such as placing sensors in the ocean to monitor ocean health, can then be turned into NFSeas with visualizations of reefs and corals that people can buy and funds can go towards blue initiatives, NFBees for bee health.  

The expansion of the impact NFT could serve as a way to monitor our planetary health via digital twins, and to allow economic autonomy from plants and planetary accounting to be integrated into our economic model.

Our project is just in the very beginning stages of setting up the foundation of how this could be implemented.

The DAO is an exciting concept whose core is the desire for equal authority, multi-party decision-making, and the elimination of uncontrollable risks arising from authoritarian governance as much as possible. DAO is a new type of management that was born for governance.
As the most in line with the spirit of blockchain governance, DAO must have its place in the blockchain ecological map, and is an indispensable and important piece of the puzzle.
What is the Cityflysky
Cityflysky is a DAO that provides tools for DAO organizations, and its core is to provide rich, easy-to-use DAO tools for creating and using DAO.
 Cityflysky will provide an easy-to-use DAO creation tool that requires minimal gas and a few minutes to fill in the data to create a DAO.
Different DAOs will provide a one-of-a-kind city NFT .
Our Vision
Voluntary commitment
Since the name of DAO is ""Autonomous Decentralization"", there is no specific authority. In the ""company"", the ""CEO"" makes decisions and gives instructions to the ""employees"". In ""DAO"", there is no ""CEO"" in the first place. Of course, there is no concept of ""employee"" either. In DAOs, the pyramid structure is basically negated. The premise of working at DAO is that ""everyone actively demonstrates his/her special abilities and contributes to the project"". You are always a ""proposer"" and a ""contributor"", and the DAO needs your advice and contributions. It can be said that in order to work in DAO, your project and your interests need to have a high degree of fit. Your contribution is maximized when ""what you can/want to do"" and ""what the DAO should do"" overlap. If you work for a DAO, no one will give you directions. If you can contribute a lot, you will be recognized as a ""core contributor"" and will be rewarded and honored.
Regardless of age, gender or nationality, pay for performance and participate anonymously 
In the past, when working at a company, it was necessary to verify the identity of a person, but at DAOs, this common sense is outdated. When you work for the DAO, you are not required to provide more personal information than is necessary. Because DAOs are anonymous, they are also paid per contribution. Regardless of your age, gender or nationality, what matters is your contribution to the DAO. Prehistoric worker spirits, such as ""work earlier than others, show loyalty"" and ""be loyal to your boss"" are completely a thing of the past. Welcome to a flat, pay-for-performance society.

7403,PunStar,2,0x0,"Project Name
PunStar 
Register to http://punster.stonelens.com/ and start your fun journey. Check the Front UI Tutorial if you are new to Flow.
More details are in our Pitch Deck
Description
Problem statement
We are exploring a decentralized digital social network. By building a next-generation NFT architecture based on resource-oriented chains to express various social relationships and interactions in the Web3 world, and asset all this, so that the value of social capabilities of every participant could be confirmed and clarified.
PunStar is an initial form of this social network. Firstly, we will build this platform on Flow due to its unique resource-oriented features and next this will be extended to more resource-oriented chains like Aptos and Sui. Besides static content features and combinability of normal NFT, we take advantage of resource mechanisms to coalesce some innovative properties into NFT and asset them. The innovative properties include dynamical social relationships between participants established by resource interactions, executable abilities based on methods bound to resources (some of which have realistic meanings, e.g. advertising), and upgradeable features like Funny index which may actually increase NFT's value.
In this stage, PunStar chooses Funny things as the entry point of the social network, which could be easily extended in the future. The participants of PunStar are called ""Punsters"" (an NFT) and they can share their funny things in the form of ""Duanji"" (an NFT). Each person can express their preference for a ""Duanji"", which can stimulate the construction of social relationships between participants and let it possible to estimate the ""funny index"" of each ""Punster"". The ""Punsters"" can make content promotions(e.g. publish ads) based on their relationship constructed in PunStar, which needs to satisfy some restrictions based on the ""funny index"" first. We use resource mechanisms to coalesce social relationships, content promotion, and some other practical abilities into NFT, which is a great enhancement to the existing NFT, allowing NFT to be more realistic and of greater practical value.
Highlights
Brings associativity abilities to NFT with related assetization
As we know, on resource-oriented chains things can be bound to each resource, so resources can actually have their own abilities, such as social relationships based on the following mechanism. This is very different from the smart-contract-based chains where everything is published on smart contracts. Resources can be exchanged, so the bound abilities such as relationships can be exchanged too. This improves the potential value of the Punster NFT, as relationships can be combined with the advertising ability for instance. Punsters with more followers might be more valuable.
Brings execution abilities to NFT: Such as advertisement mechanism
Punsters can push advertisements to their followers with limitations of some conditions based on the funny index mechanism. This is a demonstration of a specific feature of resource-oriented NFT, which is the implementation of executable abilities bound to NFTs.
Brings dynamical growth abilities for NFT
Some dynamic abilities of Punsters could grow as they make contributions. For example, the funny index will increase if someone's Duanji is commended by others. And the funny index will influence the cooling time of Punster's advertising ability.
Assetization of all the social capabilities in PunStar
Assets in PunStar can be accessed Omnichain
Interesting things should be shared with others. Users can enjoy some special abilities of PunStar deployed on resource-oriented chains from other chains without losing the specific features of resources.
Background
Target audience:
Everyone can share funny things with each other, and enjoy funny stories from other punsters. So this is a product for every socialized humanity.
Evidence for the need:
We can find some similar successful products in the Web2 world, such as Facebook, Twitter, WeChat Friend Circle, etc. But there're some uncomfortable things in the Web2 world that the ownership, control, and disposal of assets do not belong to individuals. PunStar starts building its social platforms with funny topics, at the same time, social relations and advertising mechanisms were created based on the full use of resource features.
Proposed solution
Product

People publish Duanji to share funny things.
If one person thinks some other punsters are interesting, he can follow them to get the newest information as soon as the following punsters publish any updates.
If one person likes a Duanji, he can commend it, so that, the ""Funny Index"" of the Duanji will be increased, and the related punster who published the Duanji.
Punsters can push advertisements to their followers based on the funny index.
Both Duanji and Punster are NFTs that can be exchanged between different participants.
Besides resource-oriented chains like Flow, Aptos, and Sui, we are trying to provide advertising access interfaces to other chains, without losing the unique resource features.
Technology Architecture
 The key points of the technology are as follows:
Duanji is our new architecture NFT compatible with ERC series standard. Besides static content properties, Duanji has its dynamic feature funny index.
Punster is our new architecture NFT compatible with ERC series standard, and it is also an NFT container. A Punster NFT can contain lots of Duanji NFTs. The dynamic properties of Punster include
Following mechanism can be implemented easily based on resource interactions.
Funny index evaluation algorithm in the Commend mechanism can make out an estimation of how funny a Duanji or a Punster is, which depends on both commending counts and time passed.
Advertisement mechanism based on funny index of Punsters.
StarRealm and Cross-Chain Locker provide a Star Port for NFTs to travel to other chains.
Marketing
The funny Duanji is used as the initial entry point for the topic to start the market.
Give NFT more dynamic and practical value based on resource-oriented mechanisms to attract more users to create to build their social relationships.
Assetization the practical value of both Duanji and Punster NFTs, and make everything tradable, so that to improve the activity of PunStar platform.
Bring in more dynamical and practical abilities to Punster and Duanji NFT, such as E-commerce.
Besides funny things, bring in more topics like dating to inspire users to enhance their social relationships.

7211,BlockGurus REALTOR & MLS integration,2,0x94E14eeFc7C038F5Abb3F1ded895a312633eA5cC,"BlockGurus aims to address a disconnect between the potential utility of smart contract blockchains to real estate, and the actual lack of market penetration of such technology.

Real Estate is a perfect business vertical to embrace web3 and blockchain technology,  especially smart contract technology. Yet after a decade of hearing how this would happen, the inroads are still quite unimpressive. This is because the target audience has not, until now, had a practical way to get familiar with the possibilities.

Real Estate is a fractured marketplace, with unnecessary hurdles to normalized data and a genuine consumer centric experience. We believe that this means that the 'killer app' that onboards this vertical needs to be something that is at once:

simple
familiar
affordable
actionable
unobtrusive

We believe, based on practical experience, that ENS is that onramp. Real estate was a singularly large consumer of web2 domains/hosting - it is a marketing technique that agents are quite familiar with. They already like to brand themselves and their brokerage with names - ENS is a natural transition. It is simple, familiar, affordable, actionable and benign to existing models.

In turn, on the other side of the real estate experience, consumers lack access to a reliable, transparent source of information. Realtors for their part have no decentralized, viable resource to express their genuine, verifiable value proposition.

BlockGurus efforts attempt to resolve this inefficiency by pioneering an industry specific Ethereum Identity Space, for real estate. We hope to provide REALTOR® associations with a free public good in the form of the web3 infrastructure to:

Teach them to claim a web3 identity in the form of their 8 digit License ID (this may prove harder than we anticipated given the popularity of digits!)
Provide them with 'tokens of their trade' essentially - in the form of POAP tokens


BlockGurus acts as plumbing, providing a translation layer for the 1100 local REALTOR® Associations in the US to Oracle their data into web3.

We provide Association staff the data/utility to tokenize the following:

ENS name registration
ENS subdomain management
Licensed REALTOR® status
Certifications & Designations
Annual Election ‘I Voted’
Committee & Board Service
Annual Charitable Contributions

Since we aim to provide this utility as a free public good we are looking to identify grant funding. As referenced, we are nearing an MVP, and have a tentative MOU for Business Development Operations with the 4,000 member Contra Costa Association of REALTORS®, and are in discussions with the Northern San Diego Association as well.

On the technology side, we have worked closely with several key staff at POAP, and await the subcontract update from ENS. For more nuance and texture on what we are trying to do, we strongly encourage you to listen to some of our onboarding podcasts.

An example of one of our first POAP


CCAR's incoming Board President xyz profile



A glimpse at our portal staged in development

With the benefit of the updated subwrapper contract options, our ultimate goal is to tokenize real property parcels as well as instances of MLS properties/listings using ENS and subdomains, such that every property, and every listing of that property, is wrapped as an ENS asset. At this point, attribution for these assets accrue to the agents involved, and become their 'proof of work' if you will, where their ENS name is the key reference.

We engineered a web analog of this in a sense, with a few members of our team way back in 2008 on a service called streeturls - where we subdomain every property and present it as a single property webpage - sorry for the very dated appearance, we haven't updated it since 2010... but you can see:

a community index here:http://danville.ca.streeturls.com/
a single property http://3332.green_meadow_dr.danville.ca.streeturls.com/
an agents sales history buy/sell side https://streeturls.com/agents/206525972/history

The idea here is obviously to do something conceptually similar to this with ENS. The resulting identity space would have many potential efficiencies over existing models, as well as the clear basis to create many more.

We believe our application, at this time at least, is best categorized as addressing these two of the presented goal set:

Usability - improving the user experience
Community - growing the ecosystem

We are happy to provide additional information as needed, and appreciate your consideration.

It is a co-living and co-working space for scientists, Web3.0 communities, designers, and digital nomads. OpenCampus is now evolving into a DAO-based Re-Fi and De-Sci project. 




HOW IT WAS STARTED

A group of willing people related to science, technology and design from all over the world, we have been together to share our knowledge and experiences with new generations and beginners, and we have organized a 9-day camp called HacknBreak since 2016. In curation, we were inspired entirely from open source, free software, open science and open innovation cultures, and communities. These events were also an environment where the blockchain communities in Turkey came together for the first time. HacknBreak was creating a free learning environment in peace where curious people learn from each other. 

https://youtu.be/rBPkIKB5d74


We held these activities on the land we rented in Urla, İzmir. Every year we restore it with a small budget for HacknBreak while preserving its nature and biodiversity. We called this area OpenCampus. 

We did it together. We can do it again.


In the past 6 years, more than 700 scientists, academics, and professionals from all over the world have volunteered in our projects and activities. In this period, we have built a community with our 15.000 event participants who came together, met, became friends, and formed various partnerships in OpenCampus. We believe it is now time to bring this network to a next level.

-> OpenCampus Presentation




BEST PLACE FOR THE LOCKDOWN TOO 

We decided to cooperate to keep OpenCampus alive, and found a cooperative called ScienceCoop. Right after founding the coop, the pandemic started. During pandemic closures, we organized dozens of free online events and bootcamps for developers, scientists and designers. (https://www.youtube.com/c/OpenCampusTR/videos) We came together with small groups physically in isolated OpenCampus land, lived together, and tried sustainable agricultural activities.



During the pandemic, together with our cooperative partners and a few community members, we started to think and work on some projects to make the world more resilient to climate change. Some of those;

* R&D and P&D activities related to sustainable building materials resistant to earthquake and climate crises using hemp and artichoke agricultural wastes,
* New planting and irrigation techniques that will reduce water and chemical fertilizer consumption against the risk of global drought.
* Designing and developing a prototype of Smart Mobile Home based on BioComposite materials to minimize embodied carbon into building infrastructure.
* DAO and blockchain-based industrial plantation platform w/Chromia (C4EST - https://sciencekoop.org/en/c4est/)




THE FIRE!
On July 17, our OpenCampus where we carry out group work on projects, come and live together and organize camps and events, was completely burned, along with the trees, materials and equipment inside, as a result of the fire that broke out in the neighboring lands. 






WHAT WE WILL DO

We want to rebuild OpenCampus, the place where we will realize our projects that we have been working on for a long time. This seems like a complex problem, but we believe that it will be solved if it is rethought and redesigned with the collective mind of the community.

OpenCampus in the existing land will be a pilot model for co-living and co-working places in nature where Web3.0 communities, scientists, designers and digital nomads live, use and produce. Together with the C4EST platform, we aim to spread the OpenCampus model to the other cities under the pressure of climate change in order to create large green corridors between the cities and the rural areas.




We believe that we can achieve this by creating a model based on open source and community support that can be applied in other cities with our expanding community with existing and newly added members.

Can you imagine a place where like-minded people, solarpunks, geeks, ecologists, scientists etc come together in a place close to the city but green, built without using any cement, plastic-free, generating its own energy, recycling its waste? Yes, we can imagine, and we called it OpenCampus. 
  
OpenCampus is now evolving into a DAO-based Re-Fi and De-Sci project. Be a part of our community!

7165,Biomimetic Tokenomics,2,0x0,"	Biomimetic means mimicking nature. Biomimetic tokenomic systems seek to mimic nature on the large scale, including celestial events like high noons and full moons. Just like the Sun gives you light every day, a biomimetic economy gives you daily tokens.
	
	We’ve been playing with this concept for years, and are now putting it into smart contracts.
	
	We're looking for some help, both in code and financial support, to complete these open-source contracts being built in public. The code is over 70% completed, and you can preview the contract structure later on in this grant proposal. 
	
	For now, let’s talk more about the concept. 
	
	The idea is to time-limit “Up-inion” with fungible tokens as a basis for an economy. This works best with the daily distribution is linked with a daily utility-case, such as a Top Chart or similar vote-based system. It could even be used to improve Gitcoin’s fairness. 
	
	The code is open, so we look forward to all kinds of use-cases. Here’s the one cXc is working on. 

	🟣Purple is a three-token Biomimetic Economy where participants receive daily SOL to shine their light on content they love with a ""Sol Up"" (costs 1 SOL) that pays the content's creator a BLUX, which can Blu Up (costs 1 BLUX). Whoever gets the most Ups each day earns the real prize, PURPLE.
		
	Background
	
	After developing the idea, I wrote the web 4 paper to share the underlying concepts. Later, cXc, created the first implementation of a biomimetic economy called PURPLE. Now, these contracts are being developed in public, and seeking support on Gitcoin. We are looking for coders to help take these concepts to solidity + rust, help reviewing out C++ contracts, and to mouths to spread the idea of Biomimetic Economies.

The “Giant Lab for Better Diagnostic for Neglected Diseases” is a new program by Just One Giant Lab. This grant will help us set up the foundations for the creation of this community-driven decentralised laboratory.   

Objectives of the Giant Lab:

The objective is to 
Decrease the impact of neglected infectious diseases in low and middle income countries
Develop and provide low-cost, rapid and easy to use point-of-care diagnostic tests for human and animal neglected tropical diseases, especially the ones strongly connected to the environment. 
Additional key features of the tests to be developed are optimal stability/storage (with no cold chain needed), local manufacturing and regulatory process. 
All the designs will be shared using open source licences.

We will mobilise the community around three major tracks: 
Iterative improvement of the diagnostic technology taking local constraints into account and adaptation to target diseases
Clinical validation of the tests
Local manufacturing and empowerment of local actors

So far:

We have brought together a consortium of partners (Institut de Recherche pour le Développement, FIND, GOSH, AfricaOSH…) and are seeking our first source of funding. Ultimately, we aim at a 500k dollars annual budget over 4 years. 

With this grant:

We have two initial goals for this grant: 10000 dollars and 30000 dollars. With that, we will:
Mobilise 200+ contributors (scientists, engineers, designers, NGOs…) 
Fund a few local proof of concept
Establish a network of local actors capable of local manufacturing of these tests. 

Budget:
Microgrants [50%]
Incentivizing the project holders using microgrants (up to 2000 dollars) for validated projects - this goes a long way in the global south.
Organization of two rounds (one every 3 months)

JOGL Operations and Infrastructure [50%]
Community mobilization and animation 
Creation of the program flow for applicants
Mobilization campaign (graphics and social media)
Support to the community (community events)
Digital Infrastructure Development 
Support of the continuous improvement of the JOGL open source infrastructure
Maintenance of the platform
Fellowship and Leadership of programme 
Evaluation of the community program 
Sharing of the observation as a public report after 1 year of activity
Creation of the program flow for applicants
Analysis and sharing of peer-review results 

More details:

There is a broad interest for the development of such tests in order to increase accessibility of diagnostics, especially in rural / remote areas. Ultimately, this will help improve data on disease prevalence on a larger scale (including secluded areas), and in the long term could lead to implementing a sustainable surveillance system.

We will do that through the creation of a decentralised research network of actors (Researchers, entrepreneurs, makers, local practitioners) capable of fast and agile collaboration for the development of low-cost and open source molecular diagnostic solutions optimised for neglected diseases in low and middle income countries (LMIC) in a One-Health context.

Here are the constraints that we will be taking into account for the design of solutions:
Non-invasive (saliva, urine, microvolume blood sample), adapted to the pathogen and the host
Low-cost (affordable for local public health infrastructure)
Open licences for easy design sharing and cost control.
Easily manufacturable locally to limit logistical cost
Regulatory approval (alternative to FDA and CE)
Adapted to use by non-technicians
No need for heavy equipment
Room-temperature stability for use and storage

We will use the LAMP (Loop-mediated isothermal amplification) technology as a foundational tech because:
“LAMP techniques, sometimes promoted as “field methods,” are also very promising [144]; however, they remain in the hands of those laboratories that implemented their initial development and have never reached the stage of practical and widespread use, so they have never been really validated”. https://parasitesandvectors.biomedcentral.com/track/pdf/10.1186/s13071-022-05190-1.pdf
Easy to prototype
Some patents are expired
No need for heavy equipments
Low-cost

We will use the JOGL approach to structure, engage and animate the community. It relies on five pillars:
A scalable digital open source platform capable of connecting very large numbers of stakeholders and fostering collaboration, currently with 8000 members from 100+ countries.
An open and continuous community-based evaluation framework that offers due-diligence services to all initiatives proposed by the community,
An agile funding model providing fast and additive microfunding (2-20k per microgrant) to initiatives positively evaluated by the community, where applicants are also reviewers,
The creation of scientific and technological commons to facilitate egoless collaboration and faster information propagation, and
A community animation dynamic that is efficient at fostering collaborations and support among all members of the community.

We are aiming at making a proof of work using a simple agenda of 6 months of preparation and 1 year of facilitation with the objective of developing the first iterations of tests for a couple of diseases. If successful, the program will be strengthened and scaled to even more partners and diseases.

We will use the two following neglected diseases as targets for our proof of concept .
Leptospirosis
There is currently no rapid diagnostic tests available in LMIC used as a routine test (too expensive)
The most used test is a serological one and requires heavy equipment and a lab environment with trained technicians to run it.
It is a disease that concerns as much humans as animals. Environmental contamination is often the driving factor and so must be more thoroughly studied
We need to do more surveillance in order for local governments to design better public health policies and to enable faster reaction to potential pandemic threat
LAMP-based tests have been developed by labs but remain research-use only
Trypanosomiasis

Giant Labs are the embodiment of the JOGL approach on a specific thematic or problem. They are egoless spaces made to facilitate collaboration between stakeholders and motivated contributors, where resources and funding can be pooled and redistributed asymmetrically as additive microgrants to initiatives positively evaluated by the collective intelligence of its community. Giant Labs have several advantages compared to traditional academic labs or R&D companies. They reduce the cost of prototyping ideas by 10, they produce open knowledge and open source solutions, they are capable of supporting more risky ideas and non-traditional profiles (independants, makers, students…) and they even enable the merging of similar initiatives. It’s not about who comes first but how we go far together.

The Just One Giant Lab platform has hosted the creation of hundreds of open source projects, and chief among these projects are our collection and consortium of RT-LAMP tests, able to detect specific DNA fragments using custom primers, and allow for these to be visualised in an easy 20 minute time frame. What's more, we have funded the creation of genomic labs in the Philippines and started antiviral projects such as symptom related AI that scrolls through twitter, quarantine enabling apps, as well as self diagnostic apps and a web service for tracking and identifying AMR based in Africa. We have recently in the OpenCOVID19 programme : https://app.jogl.io/program/opencovid19 connected thousands of volunteers, and funded the best talent in an extremely efficient funding process known as microgrants to create hundreds of projects to tackle the current pandemic, many of which are based on diagnostics, but also many of which are hindered by lack of funds to take their project further in many cases.",Valid Ethereum Address. https://parasitesandvectors.biomedcentral.com/track/pdf/10.1186/s13071-022-05190-1.pdf unable to be reached. https://app.jogl.io/program/opencovid19 unable to be reached.

7119,Sciverse,2,0x1db615991d0aAEc4E424D997F7B0Bc1f06D1403B,"What is the idea behind Sciverse?
Imagine it is 1952, Rosalind Franklin is generating X-ray crystallographic images in King’s College London. Two researchers at Cambridge, Francis Crick and James Watson, will eventually make use of one of these images (photo 51) to propose the famous double helical structure of DNA. We have built so many tools in genetic engineering that rely on this specific knowledge. What if in 1952, Watson and Crick could sell their [read Rosalind Franklin’s] photo 51 to the science enthusiasts in a public auction? Would you collect it?

Now, go back a little further in time to 1866: Gregor Mendel, a monk working in a monastery, published a work using peas to describe how the heredity is transmitted in discrete unit — this unassuming work would eventually form the foundation of genetics as we know it today. What if your great grandfather who was then a farmer with an interest in Mendel’s work with peas bought the picture sold by Mendel in 1866? About 3 generations later you would realise that your great grandfather collected the original copy of one of the finest works of science in history.

Any piece of original scientific finding auctioned in such a way at the time of the discovery will of course have a huge collectible value. Moreover, it gives back to science in a small way — for instance, it could have funded Mendel’s next follow up experiments which he probably never got around doing because of lack of funds. Most importantly, this concept contributes to increasing public awareness and engagement in Science at a scale that was not possible before — by encouraging general public to actively participate in the ongoing research and collect the findings while giving back to the scientific community in whatever small way possible. This is now possible to implement easily as non-fungible tokens (NFTs) have verifiable ownership and can be easily be stored, displayed, transferred and traded.

Another fun part is that unlike a lot of the projects creating artificial use cases for NFTs based on limited supply and artificial rarity in their collection, the Sciverse collection does not need such artificial scarcity or rarity elements associated with it— it naturally evolves over time based on how the underlying scientific works stand the test of time. Your collectible might win a Noble prize but it might also fail the rigour of scientific reproducibility — and only this will determine how sought after your collectible will be in the future.

What is the Sciverse collection about?
Sciverse selects the best contemporary scientific works and mints its representative art work (microscopic images or videos/ piece of data/ abstract illustration) as a collectible work of sciart. Every artwork represents a published digital object identifier (DOI) or equivalent. This artwork lives forever on a decentralised public blockchain for generations to see. This collection can be viewed here: https://opensea.io/thesciverse

What is the Sciverse Museum?
Using the aforementioned collection, Sciverse organizes thematic (neuroscience to evolution to astronomy) exhibitions in the metaverse. This is organized in the Sciverse Museum, the first contemporary science museum in the metaverse: https://thesciverse.xyz/

Currently on display are the genesis pieces in the Genesis Hall which focus on the past. Moving forward, the focus will shift to the present — scientific works of today. With this, we are introducing an exciting new approach to science popularisation! The first two halls to open after the Genesis Hall are the Curie Hall and the Levi-Montalcini Hall which will be focussed on cancer/ cell biology and neuroscience, respectively.

Who can contribute to Sciverse?
Researchers and artists can pitch any work published in 2021 or after to be part of the Sciverse collection of contemporary science. Researchers are welcome to submit their own works of science with a related image or media that they want us to use to represent the work. Artists are welcome to submit illustrations depicting a particular scientific discovery through an artist’s eye. Here is the form to make a new submission: https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLScxHtygAEe73nVPtw_0Iq-5PXOozYNoBm704YlsdB9Pg7EmIw/viewform?usp=send_form

How do you plan to use the funds raised by selling the pieces?
Currently, we do not sell the sciart pieces. Our primary goal is to curate and display the best works of science for generations to see (no profit intended!).
However, if and when your submission is sold, you will receive 90% of the primary sale proceeds to your ethereum address provided in the form. You can use this to do more cool science/ sciart works if you like! We think giving funds back to the people who do amazing work is the best way to support innovation.

As for the remaining 10% , in the early days we hope that it will help Sciverse to self-sustain (it is currently a fully self-funded project at the time of writing). If and when Sciverse collection is able to move a lot of volume, we might use a part of the Sciverse treasury to fund public good projects related to science. Guess who will decide which project/s to fund? The holders of the Sciverse collectibles, of course! In this way, we hope to become a thriving ecosystem for public engagement in science focussed on both science education and funding through sciart in the interconnected halls of the Sciverse.

Sounds interesting? Join us!
See you in the Sciverse.

But it's a good idea to be aware of exhaust system flaws. Here is a quick breakdown of exhaust-related issues.

A Malfunctioning Oxygen Sensor Fails To Intimate The ECU Properly.

The oxygen sensor is used by the exhaust system to collect data about the gases that are supposed to be released into the environment. When the task is finished, the ECU starts the internal combustion process.

The ECU, on the other hand, fails to produce the proper air-to-fuel ratio if there is any malfunctioning. As a result, the combustion chamber does not receive the proper fuel, and the process has a good chance of going wrong. 
Either mixture could heat up too much or the combustion chamber converts energy inefficiently. It even damages the catalytic converter and causes the engine to misfire on occasion.
 
A sensor failure is a difficult problem to diagnose, though. Engine misfiring initially appeared to be an issue with the engine. 
However, you can speak with a specialist at Service My Car to get the right assessment of the problem and the right fix for the same.

Exhaust Smoke Hints At Some Underlying Issue

It is normal for combustion to produce smoke. However, it should be colourless, as coloured smoke is a sign of trouble. There could be grey, white, blue, or black smoke. The coloured smoke, however, typically arises from some flaws in the combustion process.

The blue smoke is typically created when engine oil burns inside the engine. Because of worn valves, cylinder walls, or a faulty head gasket, engine oil may leak into the combustion chamber.
 
On the other hand, black smoke results from the engine using more fuel than it should. The main cause of these problems turns out to be a clogged air or fuel filter. However, you can opt for an air filter replacement at a reliable service centre to counter the issue. If the smoke is white or grey in colour, coolant leakage is to blame.

Exhaust Leakage May Result From the Presence of Malodorous Inside Cabins

There are many chances for leakage into the system manifold or even one of the joints throughout the exhaust system, which extends from the front to the rear and heavily relies on the pipes.

However, a leak at the manifold poses a threat because it could let toxic fumes into the cabin while the engine makes loud noises.

Since toxic gases in smoke are purified by the catalytic converter but escape due to leakage, the passenger may be in danger of dying as a result of the leak.

A Failed Catalytic Converter May Hamper the Engine's Performance

However, a failed catalytic converter could cause issues if it becomes clogged or damaged as a result of overheating. The catalytic converter does the trick of converting the dangerous gases into safe steam to release into the environment. Sometimes, the converter is exposed to emissions containing substances that coat the working surfaces, catalyst poisoning happens.
 
Many times, drivers ignore the warning signs of a failing catalytic converter and believe their car is still in good condition. However, most of the vehicles on the road today use catalytic converters. These devices have almost become a requirement for new cars.

But, there is a serious issue with wear and tear on these expensive units, which are frequently unable to prevent damage due to the negative effects of gasoline. A defective catalytic indirectly impacts the engine of a vehicle as it hampers the combustion chamber. There is also some sort of improper fuel efficiency.

However, a proactive approach might save you more effort and time in terms of car engine repair.

Unnecessary Vibrations Are Not Healthy For A Safe Drive

You may be feeling vibrations around your steering wheel as a result of an unhealthy exhaust system. Sometimes the entire vehicle feels these vibrations, which is not a good sign for a safe drive.

You don't anticipate seeing a car causing trouble on the road. However, if you choose to seek a professional assessment and do not ignore such problems, there is a lower likelihood that something will go wrong.
 
Exhaust System Rust and Loose Hangers

Rust is a true enemy to the exhaust system as it hampers it slowly until it goes bad and starts to pose an issue. However, this is common in vehicles that do not get enough rides. The water vapours do not get enough time to burn off.
 
Besides, the exhaust system stays with your car with the help hangers. But a loose or broken hanger is not a good sign for a vehicle's exhaust system. If you need any type of car service & repair, service my car provides you free pickup and delivery at the nearest Mercedes Benz service bolton center.
 
The exhaust problems may be avoided by taking preventive measures. It requires you to inspect the exhaust system once or twice a year. However, you can ask for a professional's help during the car maintenance to identify the causes and address them properly.

7181,Port3 Grant,2,0x0,"Introduction of Port3
Port3 is the fastest growing Web3 gateway to Social Insights. Currently, it leverages a base of over 3.3 million users across Telegram, Twitter, and Discord with an average DAU of 11k. We are seeking to unlock the full potential of social data in the Web3 era.

There are three pillars to building the Port3 universe:
• Social data aggregation channel: DAO tools that aggregate social data across Web2 & Web3 platforms, capture community sentiment & enable user acquisition & engagement;
• SoGraph.xyz analysis platform: Visualized dashboard of key metrics, input/output extrapolation for community profiling, and increased transparency of each user/follower;
• Port3 Data Layer: Open and collaborative on-chain data infrastructure for Web2 & Web3 platforms to integrate for utilization of fully customized social data

We are the first project to propose the Social Data Oracle, we aggregate social data from Web2 communities & social media and On-chain, analyze with a standard algorithm or nonstandard machine learning, then output to the dashboard for visualize read & API, SDK for APPs & DAPPs

Various use-cases: smart airdrops, soulbound NFTs mint, IDO whitelisting, DAO contribution verifications, etc. To achieve automation and transparency, we cover both Web2 & Web3 integrations, the accomplishment of the tasks, to finally output a standardized list. We have the answer to the final form of Web3 social data oracle and we will be the first to achieve it (accomplishment approx. 67%, deliver in early Q4 2022)

What problem are we trying to solve?
We are trying to solve a contradiction that plagues the Web3 sector - data aggregation. More social data is needed to support smart airdrop, SoulBound, and other scenarios with the development of Web3. However there is no such data in Web3 and lots of social actions still happen in Web2, so we need to integrate the on-chain and off-chain data to meet the demand.

What we are offering and how you are solving this problem?
Port3 Network shares data by Social Data Oracle to meet the needs of the above scenarios. Specifically, we collect data from sorts of channels, and then clean, count, and analyze to get a result dataset, such as activeness index, campaign member lists, or community member lists. Finally, those data will be echoed to the Oracle Contract for the third-party DApps to read.

And we have designed the architecture so that decentralized data aggregation and reading can be achieved, which can solve the problem of trustworthiness and availability of data.

Port3 competitive advantage
Our DAO Tool Bots have covered over 4,000 communities and owned more than 3.8 million users from crypto areas. These users are constantly generating data and can be converted into SoQuest participants. But our competitors may need to get into these communities in various ways and then accumulate users from scratch.

In addition, we have rich experience in wallet development and on-chain data analysis, which can all guarantee that we are full of capacity to obtain comprehensive and sufficient data resources.

We expect to:
1. Get Gitcoin Grants and support
2. Gain exposure to projects and potential investment opportunities
3. Get feedback and suggestions from Gitcoin

tl;dr

Developing an open-source, low-cost water structuring device.
Conducting decentralized science experiments to measure the water structuring device’s efficacy in improving crop yields, reducing water usage and accelerating natural carbon sequestration.


What is water structuring?

Water structuring is a term to describe the process of organizing water molecules into a more coherent state. Water from a stream or spring becomes structured as it spirals along its natural path. We all know the difference between drinking vibrantly alive water compared to water that has been sitting in a pipe and plants know the difference too. A finely tuned water structuring device emulates the natural flow of water to optimize its life giving effect on humans and plants alike.

The Problem
﻿﻿﻿﻿
Several water structuring devices are currently available and have demonstrated promising results in agriculture, but the technology hasn’t crossed over yet as a major regenerative agriculture solution.
Available water structuring devices used in agriculture today are closed source, relatively expensive, not well known, not well distributed and do not have high legitimacy. (Vitalik outlines legitimacy well here: https://vitalik.ca/general/2021/03/23/legitimacy.html)

The Solution

We intend to design an effective, low-cost and open-source water structuring device and create legitimacy for that device through thoughtfully conducted decentralized science experiments.
We hope to collaborate with ImpactDAOs and MRV (Measurement, Reporting and Verification) efforts to offer regenerative farmers a low-risk, low-maintenance and potentially high reward solution to their farms.
We believe water structuring is a key agricultural solution with the potential to significantly accelerate natural carbon sequestration while reducing water requirements and significantly bolstering yields for regenerative farmers.
We believe that through building open-source tools and collaborating with ImpactDAOs we can positively impact farms of all sizes around the globe.

Deliverables

Phase 1) Prototype an open-source, low-cost water structuring device
Phase 2) Design a decentralized scientific study in collaboration with with ImpactDAOs, MRV initiatives and regenerative farmers.
Phase 3) Conduct the study. Measure key changes to crop and soil health with water structuring device.
Phase 4) Collect, analyze the data — publish our study and water structuring device design.
Phase 5) Iterate with feedback and results from initial study

What the funds will be used for
Research existing water structuring devices
Design low-cost prototype water structuring device
3D print prototype and run preliminary experiments
3D print and ship water structuring devices to participating farms for larger decentralized study

7497,Defi Biolabs is engineering cyanobacteria to produce scalable feed supplement to reduce  greenhouse gas emissions  in cattle.,2,0x632Fd6D5E53A8661e751a964c9d7c9aa63Ecaa5A,"Defi Biolabs is engineering cyanobacteria to produce a cheap, scalable feed supplement to reduce  greenhouse gas emissions  in the dairy and beef industry.


The Problem 

The planet is warming up and human agriculture is playing a large part in carbon dioxide  and methane emissions. Production of beef and dairy products play a large part in greenhouse gas emissions with one cow being able to produce 100 kilograms of methane per year.  Livestock are responsible for ~14% of global greenhouse gas emissions per year. 

Current technologies are unable to meet demand

Asparagopsis taxiformis, a type of edible red seaweed, has been shown to reduce the methane emissions 85% under real farm conditions  in cattle when included at  0.3% of the animals’ dry matter intake (Roque 2021). Multiple companies are building farms to grow this red seaweed as a food additive and digestive aid in order to reduce the methane emissions in cattle. The facilities needed to grow  red seaweed require thousands of acres of ocean front land to produce the final product at a cost of ~$10.0 USD per kg. 
The current bottleneck is being able to grow enough of this seaweed to use as a food additive for the cattle. 

Our Solution

 Our goal is to drastically reduce the cost and land resources necessary  to produce a food additive that can reduce methane emissions in cattle. 


Recent advances in aquaculture  have made it economically feasible and sustainable, allowing for a dollar cost average of $0.80 per Kg algae produced. Combining recent advancements in aquaculture  with  modern synthetic biology platforms, we look to circumvent the land and resources essential to farming red seaweed by engineering edible cyanobacteria that produce the secondary metabolites known to inhibit methane production in cattle rumen.  
 Companies such as Lumen Bioscience are using  engineered spirulina to produce a dried biomass which can  deliver therapeutic payloads to treat bacterial infections. Our goal is to deliver an edible biomass containing methanogenic inhibitors to the rumen of cattle in order to reduce methane emissions. 
 
Who we are:
 
Defi Biolabs is an LLC in the state of Wisconsin  composed of  a group of recent PhD graduates from the University of Wisconsin - Madison. We are looking to develop carbon removal  technology using cyanobacteria. Defi Biolabs is a registered team competing in the X-prize for carbon removal looking to meet the goal of removing  1000 tonnes of CO2 per year. 
 
Where we are now
 
We recently finished building our lab and have assembled our first genome as a candidate for bioengineering. 
 
Our next goal is to begin cloning biosynthetic gene clusters from the red seaweed into our cyanobacteria and look for expression of those proteins and secondary metabolites.  From there we will look to optimize growth conditions and maximize the production of the secondary metabolites of interest. 
 
 
What will the money we raise go towards?
 
 
$0-2000
Will pay for 1-2 months of reagents, chemicals and media  necessary to perform molecular and microbiology experiments.
 
$2,000-10,000
Will allow for us to buy the remaining equipment we need to finish the essential equipment for our lab including purchasing an ultra low temp freezer,  nanopore sequencer for long read genome sequencing and a spectrophotometer.
 
$10,000-50,000
This will provide us with a 6 month-1 year  runway to perform experiments  and cover the cost of reagents. 
 
$50,000-$100,000
This will provide a runway for a year to perform all experiments necessary and provide an opportunity for defi biolabs to engineer our strains.
 
 
$100,000+
 Means I can quit my day job and work on this project full time. This will grant us an opportunity to establish our product and look to receive seed funding  and work together with the ginkgo bioworks synthetic biology platform to bioengineer cyanobacteria to meet our needs. 
 
 
 
About the founders: 
 
I completed a PhD in genetics in 2021 from the University of Wisconsin Madison and have over 10 years of experience working with bacteria. I have an  extensive background  in molecular biology, genetics, biochemistry and microbiology.  My thesis work  focused on bacterial physiology and how bacteria adapt to changes in nutrient availability and I am always excited to talk about biotechnology and microbiology. 
I am currently working together with my partner who is an experienced bioinformatician and microbial ecologist.
 
Together we are looking to bring our skills as an experienced  microbiology and bioinformatics expert to the forefront of synthetic biology and algae culture.

General mechanic
The feed is custom for you. Each post is a question, an opinion, or a poll. You can open a post and read what others say anonymously and, if you wish, reply anonymously.

You can make custom compilations using tags to see what people say on certain topics and in certain locations.

A post can only contain text so that no one could track you. We don’t gather location data to guarantee anonymity. Our profile pics are avatars. When you post, you can choose your avatar’s emotion.

We’re for the real freedom of speech. This means that the feed may contain posts that you may not like. We’ll mark such content for you. It’s on you if you want to read that or not. If you see content like this and it’s unmarked, let us know and we’ll reward you and take measures immediately.

Resonance is our internal currency. You can spend that to customize your avatar. You can’t buy it, but you can earn it by reacting to posts, creating ones, and leaving comments. 

Avatars
Every user has an avatar instead of their real identity. At first it’s the anonymous pigeon in a hood.

You can get your avatar in exchange for your resonance. It’s random, but you can always change certain attributes in exchange for your resonance. They are also randomly generated and are of different quality: basic, rare, legendary. Legendary attributes turn your avatar into an animated sticker, and you can use it to react to posts. The sticker stays in your collection for good.

You can change your avatar’s emotion to one that reflects your current mood and pick an emotion for a post. 

To get access to an avatar and to earn resonance, you need to create an account. We don’t gather any personal data. Your nickname is randomly generated. Your password is a seed phrase. Store it in a safe place, best of all – in your mind. It’s the only thing associating you with the platform.

Problem Statement

What is the #1 problem facing humanity right now? 

Climate change affects all life on earth - not only human beings but flora and fauna alike.

What is one of the #1 contributors to climate change? 

Human production/consumption of physical goods significantly contributes to climate change. Specifically, plastics, because they’re so ubiquitous but also because they’re a by-product of one of the most significant negative contributors — fossil fuels.

What is the #1 problem with the status quo in light of this reality?

Plastic recycling is broken. 100% of plastic is not recycled; lots of it either gets incinerated, shipped to the Global South, or thrown into landfills.

Why should we address this problem? 

While the everyday consumer might say — ""it’s not my problem; it’s up to the recycling industry to change"" — we believe shifting blame to others isn’t helpful.  

Plastics are everywhere. Plastic waste affects all human beings regardless of socioeconomic status, demographic differences, and geopolitical allegiances.

How would we address this problem? 

Given the status quo, we need to:

Find a more effective way to repurpose plastics because they will continue to be produced due to their entrenched nature in human society.
Find a more efficient way to distribute this solution to as many people as possible.
Find a more enticing way to attract more and more people to said solution and enable said solution to be as global as possible.

What could we do to address this problem? 

We have a more effective way to reproduce plastics — it’s called Precious Plastics.



The problem is that we don’t have a very efficient and enticing way to distribute plastic pellets and attract more people to them. Precious Plastics has a community, a nonprofit umbrella organization behind it, and it is global already; however, it’s not as ubiquitous as the plastic it’s trying to recycle. 

We want to build upon the great work of Precious Plastic by turning plastic into a public good so we can close the loop on the production and consumption of plastics. It’s not going to be easy, it’s a lofty goal, but we can start by bringing the Precious Plastic onto the Web3.0 train because it will help them better scale, sustain, and systematize their operations.

What is Circular Economics?

We are using up Earth’s finite pool of resources at an unsustainable rate, leading to climate change. Circular Economics (CE) is a new domain in economics which aims to solve this problem with sustainability at its core. Circonomy is our attempt to bring CE into the real world and leverage Web3 to bring about scalable, sustainable, and systemic change.

Circular economics is an economic model in which the flow of resources in an economy is circular. In this case, plastics should be reused/recycled/upcycled until there is no more possible use case left for them. Reusing, recycling, and upcycling plastic will reduce the level of extraction and dumping of Earth's resources — giving our planet enough time to replenish its pool of resources. Hence, it is a more sustainable approach.

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3RxBIu-cd_Y



Our Solution

We’ll begin by tackling the plastic waste problem because most plastics aren’t 100% recycled, and we’ll partner with Precious Plastics. Precious Plastic is a combination of people, machines, platforms, and knowledge to create an alternative global recycling system. It’s open-source machinery that people can own and recycle their plastic into pellets.

Our solution will involve setting up small communities called ‘Circles’ — (sub-DAOs). These “Circles” will raise funds to invest in the Precious Plastic machinery, thereby gaining common ownership of said machinery. The machinery will then be registered as a node of our decentralized network, similar to Helium's (https://www.helium.com) behaviour. We (Circonomy) as the DAO forming the umbrella for all these “Circles” will create systems in the form of governance, group communication, and most important of all, a DApp to incentivize better the use of the Precious Plastic machinery within each “Circle”. The DApp will also facilitate a recycle-to-earn program for the individual and collective benefit.


Here’s a video summarizing what Circonomy is trying to accomplish:



Circonomy will issue and distribute its token: $CRCL, and will facilitate the transactions in the ecosystem. Circonomy will act as a medium to incentivize 'good recycling behaviour' for its members.

Circonomy Structure

SuperDAO = Circonomy
DAOs = Materials, i.e. Plastic DAO for which Precious Plastic will be the primary use-case here
SubDAOs = Circles AKA communities/neighbourhoods. Ideally, the Circles should be municipalities, but starting out, they’ll be neighbourhoods.
Note: Token = $CRCL

Terminology

“Circles” = neighbourhood/community
“Rounds” = crowdfunding campaigns within Circles
“Ringleader” = leaders of a Circle (someone in charge of activating the Circle, someone in charge of managing/maintaining the workspaces/machinery, and maybe even a storage ringleader) thus forming the…
“Circle Roundtable” = the leadership committee per Circle
“Knights of the Roundtable” = the core contributors of Circonomy at-large

MVP features:

Circles will include:
Crowdfunding for setting up Precious Plastic operations

Recycle-to-Earn cryptoeconomic model — they’re recycling to earn the $CRCL token; the amount earned will depend on the following factors:
Weight of Plastics
Sorted vs. Unsorted Plastics and their respective categories
The number of devices/machines as there will be a compounding factor
Price of plastic in the traditional financial markets
Where the plastic came from, however harder to track, of course, which means this won’t be a part of the MVP
Note: This will be a bell-curve; however, to prevent gamification
On-Chain Track & Trace of the recycling activity, thus leading to a decentralized circular economy where every Circle acts as a node.

The above MVP flow shows the overall design at a glance. Still, another crucial part of the flow is the “Circle Activation,” one whereby the critical thing here to note is how we envision a future where Circles are populated with more than simply Precious Plastic per sub-DAO.

To elaborate a bit further on what we mean, please see the “Register Device” step (the second one), which is about registering one or more machines/devices that enable circular economics.

MVP + features:

3 primary functions of the Circonomy Dapp;

Recycle-to-Earn cryptoeconomic model - they’re recycling to earn the $CRCL token.
Win-Win for the individual (Circle Member) and the collective (Circle): Individuals of a circle will earn X amount of $CRCL per recycling activity, but the Circle will earn X amount of $CRCL per sale of the plastic pellets. Individuals earn $CRCL from the Circle itself because the pellets become collectively owned after they’re generated.
Members may donate to/support the Circle
Ringleaders may create “Missions” - a recycling challenge, i.e. “recycle X amount of Y before the end of the month”
On-Chain Track & Trace of the recycling activity AKA this will be a decentralized recycling network where every Circle acts as a node

Circommerce = P2P marketplace

“Engage Circonomy” = DeFi component - staking, LPing, etc.

User Journey

User arrives at the DApp

User can select a DAO to participate in - “Plastics DAO”

User is then required to either activate (not create/start/setup) a SubDAO/Circle or join a Circle

If the User “activates” a Circle, then there is no active plastic recycling operation happening at that local level — AKA, no existing PP operation happening there. 
Therefore, we’ll allow the user to crowdfund for the Precious Plastic machinery to be set up in that Circle. 
It could cost about $4-to-5,000 USD to purchase the machinery parts, but there are costs for other things like electricity, storage, legal fees (perhaps), etc., for which these are most likely recurring fees.

If the User “joins” a Circle, then there’s already an active PP operation, which means the User can participate in the Recycle-to-Earn program there.

Once plastics are recycled in these Circles, activity will be tracked on-chain to ensure provenance and transparent accounting for such activity
Plastic Pellets can be sold to other individuals who may have an Etsy/Shopify/Amazon store within the Circle or outside of it.
Or, these pellets may be sold to corporations involved in producing toys, furniture, packaging, home appliances, beauty, etc.

Circle Members can also participate in DeFi activities with $CRCL 

Outside of this, they can participate in our governance. Ideally - we’d like for them to be able to vote on and discuss issues like how to grow the Circle into the whole city eventually.

The cryptoeconomics will also include the sale of 'Plastic Credits' — a plastic offsetting aspect for the Plastic DAO. 

Eventually, there will be other DAOs for materials such as Metals, Clothing/Textiles, Food, etc.

In summary, Circonomy will be undertaking the following activities:

Sales of Plastic Credits
Precious Plastic machinery will be registered as nodes of our network
Since the recycled plastic will be recorded on-chain, which is an immutable record, it can be sold to corporations as plastic credits — used as a method of offsetting carbon emissions
Distribute the gains to Circles in the form of tokens via our recycle-to-earn model

Marketplace for recycled goods & services
Circle members can sell their goods/services on the marketplace to make financial gains from their sales
Potential buyers at the marketplace can be: 3D printing companies, furniture companies, members from other Circles, etc
These goods/services must be made from or created using the recycled plastics each Circle generates. An example of a service could be someone selling homemade cooking wherein the cutlery/containers etc, can be made from recycled plastic pellets in the Circle.

DeFi Activities
Buying/Selling
Swapping
Staking + Staking Pools
Liquidity Provision (not MVP)
Farming (not MVP)

In the future, we will expand our operations to other resources like food, clothing, metals, etc.


Market Strategy

Three possible routes can either occur in series or in-parallel, or a mix of the two:

The first route would be to partner with / acquire Precious Plastic or “One Army Earth” as our first customer, given that they’re also trying to build a DAO for themselves and pilot with existing users and have them be our initial users.

The second would be to dogfood this by purchasing the Precious Plastic machinery and registering that as our first node of the Circonomy DAO

The third route would be to pivot our MVP to something that can be all-inclusive for the entire Celo ecosystem - a mix of Sapien.Network + https://www.kolektivo.co/ for Celo.


Project Stage and Current Traction

Early-stage bootstrapping right now.
We started in the KERNEL Fellowship and graduated from them
We got invited to attend EthBarcelona
We got accepted into Sapien Network - https://www.sapien.network/
We are hoping for CeloCamp to help us go from 0 to 1


Finally

How will this directly contribute to greenhouse gas reductions or facilitate climate solutions?

We aim to increase the amount of circular economic projects worldwide — starting with Precious Plastic.

We want to move the needle from the 8% recycled plastics to a much higher number. A higher level of recycling is achievable by enabling, empowering, and encouraging more neighbourhoods to set up Precious Plastic Operations with our Recycle-2-Earn Cryptoeconomic Model.

Lastly, we aim to expand to recycling other waste materials such as Textiles + Food + Electronics and partnering with companies such as Pela Earth + Volterra. This will allow us to get closer to our goal of reducing greenhouse gasses insofar as ensuring that circular economics is enshrined in our society.

7347,Hypatia Galaxy : Chinese Female Support DAO 华人女性互助社区,2,0xa644E5831a7Bef338839C31523F7fe66fdC4F5ed,"Hi there，We are Hypatia Galaxy.

Hypatia Galaxy是一个聚合帮助华人女性项目的Web3公益DAO。
我们希望在HG社区，更多华人女性能在Hypatia发起项目，和参与帮助女性项目。
能否建立凝聚女生力量的社区，让她长期走下去，Hypatia Galaxy正在实践~

What is Hypatia Galaxy
Hypatia Galaxy is a Web3 charity DAO that gathers projects aimed at assisting Chinese women.
We hope that more Chinese women in the HG(Hypatia Galaxy) community will start projects and participate in projects that help women.Hypatia Galaxy is working hard to create a community that will unite the power of women and keep her going for a long time.


Who Are We ?
Hyptatia Galaxy's members are all female who have never met , and we are spread across China and the world.We are united by a desire to assist women and to create a humane DAO with a female perspective.We actively contribute, seek common ground, and genuinely assist one another.


Our Vision
We hope，Hypatia Galaxy is
a female-led, growing community that embraces the power of female support and is welcoming, inclusive, supportive, secure, and comfortable.
A place where every independent and diverse individual can meet like-minded female partners and discover the best way to participate in the creation.
where with a close female perspective, anyone can gain knowledge, initiate projects, and gain growth, kindness, and warmth.
We hope, Hypatia Galaxy,
to investigate democracy from a female perspective and to achieve progressive decentralized governance in web3.
For a long time, pass on the warmth and goodwill of helping women.
The most rewarding thing for us would be if Hypatia Galaxy could grow and run on its own in the future without the participation of the initial core contributors.

Our Mission
Our mission is to be an inclusive, DAO that connects more women with projects.
We assist project initiators in finding contributors and share our experience running communities and projects, so that more people with ideas can easily and smoothly initiate and organize projects.
We assist women in finding projects that reflect their values.
In addition, we set up various interest groups so that more women can play in Hypatia Galaxy, a corner full of security, and also slow down to be encouraged and warmed.

Why it matters ?
Chinese women in general face a difficult situation, However, now more and more Chinese girls are forming their own groups to help more women. In reality, we find that many groups tdon't work outdue to a lack of experience in running the programs,which is a pity.And various projects are like isolate islands, and girls willing to contribute cannot find the right projects and partners.
Therefore, an inclusive platform that connects people with projects is extremely valuable.
And Web3 is a great opportunity. If there is a decentralized community that gathers projects that help women, and people who interested in this ,and the community shares the experience of the projects that have sunk in, and runs the community infrastructure so that people are not distracted by running a community, so that they can devote themselves to the projects they love.
We firmly believe that when girls band together, not only do the people being helped change and benefit, but both contributors and participants gain significant power.


What we’ve done so far:
We only started in July, and although we are small in number, we have already started to do what we can to prepare and build up the community to help

7341,Wiscle DEI-First Collaboration Network,2,0xa93CFDdB2D48Df5e7492a82ecc57a554d17F0c0C,"Wiscle’s DEI mission is to give marginalized groups equal access to wealth and opportunity by owning the systems that people use to collaborate in teams with their digital assets. We blend the best of web2 and web3 to create amazing experiences and to maximize our ability to help the 98% excluded by one approach or the other. 



Your grant contribution allows us to compensate members who build our platform, to help our community grow and to invest in mission-aligned initiatives. Our building approach puts the needs of individuals first and enables peers and businesses to access members as talent and for commerce through Wiscle’s Marketplace. As the platform and marketplace owner, our community makes the rules and receives transaction fees which capitalizes our mission. 

With scale, our better user-controlled data, ML-enhanced collaborative experiences and lower marketplace fees attract businesses and partnerships.

To create the right opportunities for traditionally overlooked groups, we’re recruiting our leadership and seeking foundational owner-members willing to help us thrive from women, LGBTQ+ and BIPOC groups. 

Product

By removing data and collaboration gatekeepers, we unlock a better quality-of-life through ownership and data-fueled experiences. And, we benefit from better experiences free of ads and the algorithmic noise designed to make us spend more money and drive us crazy. 

Wiscle Collaboration Network - Collaborate with Teams that Matter to You

A free public good that lets members communicate and collaborate with their trust circles using their data, files and NFTs. 

Contacts: The people with whom you team-up from your personal and work lives. When connected, you see their latest contact information instead of the bits and pieces of data you have for them. 

Topics: Collaboration Spaces. Each Topic has a Data View, File View, NFT View, Chat and Drop-in Audio. Invite Contacts to create multiplayer Topics.

NFT View: A view for organizing and curating NFTs into galleries across your web3 accounts and the ones you follow. Curate your NFTs into Visible, Staging, Archived and SPAM. Easily share links to curated galleries on your Socials to expand the web3 vibe!

Use your non-custodial web3 account or Wiscle Plus custodial account to deploy and mint. Custodial accounts, standard smart contracts and subsidized transactions on 0xPolygon make our experiences safe and frictionless for web3 newbies. Custodial accounts can be converted to non-custodial if members wish and when they are comfortable with the risk.


@WiscleFungies - Mint and Gift NFTs with a Tweet

Lets newbies experience the joys of NFT ownership without the cost, risk and learning curve that often scares away non-technical users. Standard NFT Fungies help Wiscle and web3 grow by giving people a safe, fun, casual and most importantly, successful ownership experience.

7328,A Decentralized Food System,2,0x0,"Raiz is creating a distributed network of vertical farms. 

We aim to empower communities to bring back ownership of what they grow and consume. 



Raiz is raizing funds to develop a web3 protocol for expanding its impact and reach.



By tokenizing urban farms & fresh greens to merge the physical and digital worlds, we make launching a new vertical farm less expensive and more scalable. Fractionalized ownership of new farms will become a reality, allowing people worldwide to finance the deployment of farms in places that need it the most.

Why Vertical Farming?

By using hydroponics and smart local farming equipment & software, we are able to reduce consumption of resources in contrast to traditional agriculture. We effectively save over 90% of water, can grow 12x of what is grown in the fields, and avoid emissions from transport & plastics throughout the supply chain.

With supply chain disruption and extreme weather events in the rise, this way of growing food will make our system more resilient.

Social Impact

Food is life.




Part of our food grown is going to the Salvation Army and people in need. We are feeding people locally grown crops with high nutritional value.

Raiz is taking the crypto experience to the real world: educating conscious plant buyers & growers about the power of decentralization and increasing the offer of sustainable investments in the Ecosystem. 



We are live! Let’s make a wider impact together.



The growing Raiz team will be forever grateful for your support!

7327,ColtonArt - Regen Art & Fundraising,2,0x6B5918D8EF9094679F4b4e1Bf397a66eA411B118,"100% of my art sales fund social causes. $154,389 have gone directly to support the Gitcoin Matching Pool by selling over 200 individual artworks over the past year.

I created this grant to cover my living expenses and, with your support, I will continue creating solarpunk art that funds our shared needs and hopefully inspires more artists to join the regen movement ☀️🌴


Solarpunk Art:

It’s easy to be hopeless given the existential risk of climate change. Fortunately, many solutions and sustainable systems already exist and what we must do now is coordinate around a shared vision. Solarpunk art gives viewers a glimpse of the thriving world we can create.

Earlier this year, I curated the ETHDenver solarpunk art gallery that brought together 36 optimistic artists to share their visions of a bright future. Today, my art weaves together solarpunk themes and specific web3 organizations that are having real-world impacts such as @all4climatedao @RegenFdn @Earthbasedsoul @ToucanProtocol @KlimaDAO @spark_eco @nori and others.
My target audience is individuals who are passionate about building a better future and curious about how Web3 can play a part.
The call to action is to (1) turn the viewer’s curiosity into further research and (2) direct viewers to NFT auctions (e.g. DoinGud.com) where 100% of funds go directly to public goods.

The first step to building a better future is imagining it. Solarpunk art gives us a peek into those futures by depicting thriving worlds that are post-scarcity and sustainable.



My work focuses on mythologizing web3 stories by creating accessible and engaging experiences for viewers. I made my big break working with Kevin Owocki on the Greatest LARP Gitcoin Fundraiser during which I made dozens of 3D models, and together we raised $500k that went to the Gitcoin Matching Pool.

My new work is CC0 and I provide many of the 3D files for anyone to use.

About me: I began my career as a 3D character artist on the Spider-Man video games (Sony). In search of more impactful creative opportunities, I became a freelance artist and joined GitcoinDAO as an artist and creative director. I worked with Kevin Owocki (Gitcoin co-founder) on the Greatest LARP Gitcoin Fundraiser during which I made dozens of 3D models, and together we raised $500k that went to the Gitcoin Matching Pool.
For the first time, I was making meaningful art that directly raised funds for important social causes. Since then, I’ve worked closely with the DAO to proliferate regen vibes across web3 while helping communities build and fund their shared needs. It’s been a wonderful adventure surrounded by kind, talented, and optimistic people that inspire me every day.
My most recent adventure started by making a pledge to give 100% of my art sales to social causes. I hope to define a “Degen to Regen” path for more artists to join the movement and channel our collective resources into building a brighter future!",Valid Ethereum Address. https://www.partybid.app/party/0xA2db0A5687F7c1F685e2E62a917b40E3133B3D8E unable to be reached. https://coltono.com/projects/VyJ00P?album_id=4358045 connection successful. https://twitter.com/mettahead connection successful. https://doingud.com/@coltonart connection successful. https://twitter.com/mettahead/status/1490799444274597891 connection successful. https://twitter.com/mettahead/status/1494389242004393992 connection successful. https://twitter.com/mettahead/status/1552143921806905344 connection successful. https://twitter.com/mettahead/status/1512157100004179973 connection successful. https://twitter.com/notscottmoore/status/1553409422713659398 connection successful. https://twitter.com/mettahead/status/1554284047097950213 connection successful. https://twitter.com/mettahead/status/1552866495268397056 connection successful. https://twitter.com/mettahead/status/1552473978672803840 connection successful. https://twitter.com/mettahead/status/1504549040641359879 connection successful. https://twitter.com/mettahead/status/1530408456657567747 connection successful. https://twitter.com/mettahead/status/1531104020655271936 connection successful. https://coltono.com/ unable to be reached. https://twitter.com/mettahead/status/1557538763206582272 connection successful.

- - - - -
Form and view: opensource API. Multipurpose user-friendly form of registration for all scientific initiatives (websites, community, forums, NGO's, University and start-ups who have internet-platform)
 
It's large and user-friendly database and registration system for:
 - independent scientists 
 - researchers
 - journalists
 - civil activists
 - volunteers & members from NGO’s
 - teams & experts from profit & non-profit organisations
 
Global Science ID using the blockchain - access from one account to thousand scientific & activists communities and to global support system for citizen and professional science TRL Alliance /Science (DeSci: Decentralized Science)
 
Websites receive public API and user-friendly opensource system of registration as in framework of support to science TRL Global Foundation spreads license to accommodate International Researcher Certificate as a registration form/to sign in absolutely free (even for organizations with paid membership). Respectively all members, registering in thousands of small scientific projects will be added to the database TRL Alliance/Science and have access to websites integrating API TRL Alliance/Science certificate Global ID
 
What is the difference from general-purpose input like Facebook or Google? 
This registration system and login, developed specifically for scientific community (including Citizen Science)
 
Basic user certificate not only for signing in to websites that have integrating our API, but researcher doesn't have to introduce themselves, because certificate already shows scientific areas of interest or areas in which user works.
By looking at the profile in trl-certificate.org you will see all three certificates (and all areas) of the user, as well as learn his/her ORCID or Researcher ID and if needed go to biography and works of a specific researcher. 
 
Working solution now: SCOPUS. But we can interact with this system. This is not direct competition, it's a mutual reinforcement.
 
+ Financing is required for specific areas TRL Alliance/Science certificate & Global ID:
1) Development of two-way API-system of registration and automatization with preparation for integration Web 3
2) Development and integration of inalienable NFT. It allows the project to receive audience without any loss. Afterwards it will allow to launch a model UGBI being the direct target of TRL Global Foundation, so it means a constant use. 
3) Implementation of AML/KYC into the project (will be complemented by third party funding)
 
+ Web3 and Global Science ID.
The next stage of development includes creation and implementation into to system Web 3:
•            Appropriation of NFT to every certificate; 
•            Integration to each profile of inalienable NFT 
•            Creating blockchain-tool for mutual data exchange with ORCID for all members TRL Alliance/Science
•            Automation of welcome accrual of digital currency CSDG to wallets of registered researchers
 
Task of TRL Alliance/Science: use data confirmed by research, implementing these results more quickly and applying them to practical areas. The first phase has a special emphasis on the area of solving social problems and the crisis of democratic institutions.
All this became possible due to the fact that the system of licences deigned for TRL Alliance / Science promotes, amongst other things, citizen science and funding of citizen advocacy right across the spectrum.
 
Our users can get connected with a pool of scientists (both local and international) to work on a single topic/project, the duration of which can last for ten or more years and which will also be supported by the TRL Global Foundation by including it in the inflation mechanism algorithm, etc.
You can find like-minded researchers in specific areas ex.: trl-certificate.org/members/?r=Economics ; ex.: https://trl-certificate.org/members/?r=Special+sectors etc. [Test mode. Sometimes not all certificates are displayed]
 
This is an open source project and does not involve any paid membership. 
We are also prioritising the creation of a “type: team_HEI” certificate for members of educational institutions. Find the certificate for 100+ organisation here: https://trl-global.org/hei or If our members are/becomes a member or a volunteer of a Non-governmental organisation for which a TRL certificate has already been released, they can activate “member/volunteer certificate” with this organisation https://trl-global.org/ngo
 
TRL Alliance/Science is an organisation with the goal of creating and financing the global network of independent scientists and civil activists. These lines of work are only parts of the overall multidisciplinary project TRL Global Foundation. The main goal of the Foundation is creation of self-regulating social mechanism in the area of rights and freedoms of persons, as well as environment, by using economic tools and algorithms specific to the economy 4.0.

IMPORTANT: The organizers of the TRL Global Foundation are distributing digital assets with the aim of increasing the popularity of blockchain technologies (for many our volunteers & researchers the Launch_TRL blockchain transaction the first one they have encountered in their lives)
 
(!!!) It is a digital token without a denomination or value. The fundamental aim of these digital assets is for new groups of people to be introduced to and familiarize themselves with blockchain technologies (for example, installing web3 wallets, understanding the publicity of the blockchain (on the example of transactions in polygonscan), etc.)
And, of course, it is much safer to learn something new without worrying about losing something valuable. Our task is to provide with the opportunity to do this.

6855,Benefits of Grant Writing,2,0x0,"Benefits of Grant Writing Jobs for Students

It is good to ask when in school why people would want to do academic writing jobs. Besides, it is also crucial to know that bachelor or masters students must submit excellent reports for any request they make. Asking for a job will enable one to be in a position to manage their education, which will have a positive impact on the career of a graduate.

Below, we have more reasons that might force individuals to seek grants from the best sources. Doing so will allow you to have better opportunities in life.

Graduate Schools Remain Top Spot in Apply For Help

To boost the chances of getting an interview call, some companies offer volunteer work. They will use the application to secure:

Qualified writers
Impressively written resumes
Gauge a level of professionalism

A qualified writer will impress the hiring committee by presenting an exceptional report. When you persuade the panel that you are the perfect candidate, you're likely to receive an invitation for an audience meeting.

There are several other advantages that applicants get while working for reputable institutions like those mentioned above. The paybacks are immense. One ends up becoming known as an authority in online marketing who claims to help people save time.

Longtime customers

Many times, fresh graduates fail to apply for a job because of simple things like sending the incorrect information. But now, graduate novices will send Their applications, whether manuscript or software. An expert will craft a winning resume within a short period. It is always a great idea to select an assistant that appreciates that people appreciate his/ her achievements.

Cover Actors

When seeking a job, a particular company passes on relevant credentials. A cover letter introduces the applicant to the potential employer. Among the important documents that an individual should touch on include:

Personal data
Educational profile
Contact list
Employment history

As a result, a prospective employee gets an insight into the personality of the writer. Was it that you were looking for a finance professional? The answer is a Yes. The person is in a better position to let anyone knowing him/her behind the scenes look at that document and understand it. Visit the link for your master papers.

6880,Grad school personal statement format,2,0x0,"Graduate school personal statement format

One primary reason for having a graduate school Personal Statement is to request guidelines from your tutors on what to include in the application document. It is crucial to present a compelling report to the relevant sources you might want to use.
Here, we have tips to guide students on how to handle a graduate school personal statement. Doing so will allow you to come up with a copy that serves the purpose of persuading the readers that you are the best candidate.

What to Include

When it comes to the structure of the graduated career bit, one should consider the following:

A summary of the Graduate School Essay

The only way you can manage to write an excellent paper from professional writer services is by providing an overview of the entire piece. As such, it is crucial to provide a vivid description of the essay. One wrong side of the story is that people will always rush to start reading the essay before checking the results. In such situations, most of them end up giving the same information to the dissertation. If you don’t do that, you might even fall behind the schedule and fail to submit a worthy report.

An intriguing introduction

For anyone to Write an outstanding Grad school personal statement, there needs to be an exciting beginning. Commonly, individuals would begin writing their graduate school documents when they are very desperate. For a successful student, you must hook the audience to your work. With an eye-catching introductory paragraph, the reader will be eager to continue reading the rest of the piece.

You also need to Provide Proofreading and Editing services. When drafting the personal statement, one should ensure that:

Correct spelling and grammar

Also, you’ll check for any typos. Luckily enough, many online tools help students solve these kinds of errors. You will develop a better understanding of the error, which will make it easy for you to correct the mistakes without paying a single coin.

Summary of the goals

What does the admission committee wants to know from the applicants? Is it a social responsibility or a technical diploma? The application documents are the means for the board to determine if a student is qualified to join the institution. Besides, where the answers are not provided, the college will deem the applicant to be below par.
It is vital to give a brief description of the accomplishments to achieve and those challenges faced. Be quick to outline all the achievements, and indicate why ones are the best fits for that particular course. The outcomes will reflect the knowledge that the student has concerning the topic.

We believe in the values of Web3 and would like to help people access DeFi and early stage crypto funding. This is why we are building on top of our tech an educative investment platform answering to regulators, investors and builders. Users will be able to create an account with KYC/AML/KYT procedures in under 5 minutes and open a wallet for which they will keep custody of the private key. By choosing a strategy on our platform (DeFi or early stage), users’ wallets are fed instructions for on-chain transactions, which will be signed by our back-end’s proxy engine.

Our unique technical-legal framework allows us to always comply with regulators while ensuring higher level of security for users (we do not pool funds, no intermediary in the financial flux, no smart contract attack surface…).

Our long-term vision is to offer a new, more transparent, secure and virtuous framework for asset management in general, by capitalising on the technical and legal opportunities offered by blockchain, while educating investors about Web3 and breaking its barriers (knowledge, technical, legal, risk management, project analysis…).

Kamea Labs was created in April 2022 and bootstrapped with 34 clients to date by offering manually managed Alpha versions of its product and services: manually managed portfolios of early-stage listed assets and private token sales for ambitious projects:
  - Our Alpha strategy is in closed beta.
  - Our Savings strategy is in closed alpha.
  - Our Private sale strategy is in public beta.

This allowed us to validate our value proposition and market appetite for it, technical-legal framework and iterate on our strategies and product. We are now ready to go through phase 2 of the project, consisting of:
  - Developing our platform MVP with sign-in, KYC/AML/KYT and commit to a strategy features (developer and product designer joining in September 2022).
  - Developing our tech: decentralised proxy engine (Substrate pallets) (undergoing with the help of the Polkadot Relayers acceleration program 2022). Our pallets will be deployed on-chain and will be composable.
  - Launching community bootstrapping and migrating to our own platform (our services are managed today from our discord server: discord.gg/kamea and landing page: kamealabs.com).
  - Filing for DASP agreement in France.

To this end, Kamea Labs would like to apply to this grant, which will be allocated in the following way:
  - Platform MVP development: €9 k (full stack developer).
  - Tech MVP development: €30 k (substrate developer).
  - Community bootstrapping: €6 k (podcasts, ecosystem mappings, waitlist bootstrapping).
  - DASP filing: €20 k (lawyers and admin charges).

The total budget for the asked grant is €65 k with €39 k allocated for tech expenses and €26k allocated for the legal and marketing expenses that are necessary at the same time to launch our MVP.",Invalid Ethereum Address.

Developing this cryptographic primitive into wallets will unlock sybil-resistant anonymous apps like zero knowledge airdrops, anonymous decentralized voting which only allows one vote per account, and message boards with a consistent identity. We think that fully executing this work will create a whole new class of dapps and web3 social apps with pseudonymity.

This grant will go to helping to integrate a new, non-interactive zk nullifier into wallets such as Metamask. Note that this scheme offers an improvement to semaphore or tornado cash nullifiers, because the first few people who sign up will not have small anonymity sets. The grant will also help to publish the paper that proves the security of the scheme via a DDH-VRF argument, and pay for conference expenses so it can be presented more widely. It will be split amongst Kobi, Aayush, Veronica, Lakshman, Wei Jie, and anyone else who would like to help productionize this work!

1. A truly fair & transparent gaming platform powered by Chainlink VRF
2. A decentralized gaming platform where ANY player can be ""The House""
3. A utility provider for ANY projects that utilizes ERC-20 tokens.


Fantom House is a truly fair, decentralized, and anonymous, crypto gaming platform on EVM where everyone can enjoy fair play and an innovative experience.

Have you ever heard the phrase, “The house always wins?”

It’s mostly true, and there could be many reasons why…

1. A ‘rigged’ house system, programmed to eventually bankrupt the player
2. A ‘House Edge’ – small or large – that benefits the House, not the player
3. And many more… who knows? They never share the source code with you.

Many online crypto gaming websites claim to be 'decentralized', while the only decentralized aspect of their platform is the currency (crypto) used for betting.

Fantom House has brought true decentralization.

At Fantom House, ANYONE can be The House. The House edge is on your side now!

However, that does not mean Fantom House only cares about depositors.

We do not use the common random function model called ‘provably fair’, which claims to be fair by using a server hash, user hash, etc. But as previously mentioned, who knows what is going on behindthe-scenes, in their well-hidden source code?

We use Chainlink’s VRF system, which does not rely on ANY party for randomness. It’s a fully decentralized way of creating randomness.

With all these amazing features, Fantom House allows users to play with VARIOUS currencies from many projects, with a higher PayOut and the lowest House Edge possible!

Our current payout schedule is 1.95-1.96x / 50% chance, which is highest standard in the crypto gaming industry!

Being truly decentralized means, ANYONE can be ANYTHING, under FAIR & TRANSPARENT probabilities.

At Fantom House, you can play TRULY FAIR games, or you can become THE HOUSE",Invalid Ethereum Address.

7302,TaterDAO brings accurate real estate data on-chain,1,0xCbbd18d3aC27ab0FFfD04BCCd091B2802c92e0ca,"TaterDAO is developing the legal and technical primitives to bring real estate on-chain.

This is an important problem to solve because the foundation of all sustainable efforts to reward and shape climate solutions are grounded in real estate.

Offices, factories, solar farms, homes, farms, and every other real world asset touches real property (i.e. real estate). Low hanging fruit climate solutions involve LED lighting, solar power, biomass, soil capture, upgrading of HVAC systems, wind energy, etc. All of those efforts happen in or on a building, home, farm or other form of real estate.

In order to identify, create and develop climate solutions, we need to accurately identify and classify land and bring that land on-chain.

All other real estate Web3 startups need what we're building to:
Accurately identify and classify real property
Create NFTs accurately representing real world property assets
Nesting an LLC within an NFT, to transfer ownership to property without having to change title
LLCs can own the title
Accurate ownership representation on NFTs allow regenerative finance operations to borrow and lend capital involving real world assets
Metadata is geared specifically for real property, with location, deeds and/or title
External oracles will be used to monitor and manage real property climate solutions in real time.

Our composable smart contracts and NFT standards enable ReFi, DeFi and climate solutions to tap into $1T worth of liquidity and unlock new business models.

Land classification data is a public good necessary for the success of all climate solutions projects. Learn more on our Github at: https://github.com/TaterDAO/app. 

Why is the TaterDAO a useful and necessary solution and an integral piece of infrastructure that Climate and Refi projects can build on?  

The reason that it is important for projects is that it would enable verifiable and on-chain ownership and management of real properties via DAOs.  So, an example would be that a DAO would be able to legally own a real property and then coordinate around concrete and on-chain benchmarks that are verifiable. The metadata would allow someone to scale a climate/refi project and provide due diligence materials to donees and/or investors, and the external links would/could point to external sources and perhaps oracles.

An example, might be to point directly to a soil, temperature, or water sensor that would allow the NFT to serve as a Treasury asset of a DAO, and also users, donors and other parties to wayfind the property location, deed, property boundaries, review important documentation and even review the data feed from the sensor.   Then with real property ownership it is trivial to have a legally wrapped DAO using the NFT as the node to enter into legal agreements, which no project is immune from.  So, with a TATR NFT a climate project could coordinate to manage DAO owned property, issue subrights, for example solar leases, or place the property into a trust that is governed by a DAO.  

Projects with climate related missions that would be natural fits to build on top of TaterDAO NFT’s infrastructure are in no particular order.

themselves own its birth and destiny. Students apply to UDAO, if they’re admitted, they
pay their tuition and in exchange they gain; 1. admission to their degree program and 2.
their tuitions worth of University coins. When they graduate, if we can create a
marketplace for liquidity, centralized or decentralized, students can sell their token on
the market and go to school debt free. The goal is to end student debt by essentially making Universities investable assets for the first time ever through tokenomics.

Whitepaper: http://bit.ly/3tgha0R

We're looking for grant funding right now in order to acquire legal counsel for incorporation. Upon incorporation, we're aiming to raise $50m in donations. 80% of 50 million would go towards the endowment we establish and be invested while the rest would go to degree program creation.

Degree programs take a long time to create, in the beginning, the endowment returns will be the only source of income we have, so we've chosen to start with the UDAO endowment in order to build the University in perpetuity.

Any grant funding not used towards legal counsel will go to the UDAO treasury where we will either allocate towards program development or the endowment.

If you're deeply interested, read the whitepaper, it has everything from the political context we operate in, to the direct roadmap we have for the university as a whole.

											WHITEPAPER:
---------------------------Intro, Pre-Face, & Political context--------------------------
	Since the late 11th century, Universities have been local, centralized, entities,
operating as the arbiters of truth, knowledge, and education. In the traditional University
system we have today, Boards, Trustees, Presidents, and Regents among others
control most of the governance structures employed within the primary educating
systems of our world, ultimately marginalizing the very people the Universities serve in
the first place, the Students. Sure, most Universities hold student body senates that
influence the governance of universities, but in most cases, student bodies usually lack
any form of formal authority to really make a difference on the Universities policies and
initiatives.
	On the other hand, student debt has reached $1.75 trillion in the US alone.
The world needs an answer, our nation needs an answer, and our children, the ones
who will bear the brunt of our failures, deserve to live in a world where education is
accessible to all. Our education system has failed us, Universities and the general
public expect the government to subsidize our higher education, yet, the very
educational institutions themselves have done little to quell the true reason our debt rate
has hiked, that is, that the tuition rates our Universities set for entrance to their
institutions have increased over 100% in the past 20 years. No amount of
government spending can bandage a hole in the wall that keeps growing. But even
then, sympathy must be administered to our failed institutions, for the hard problem they
face, is that quality of education is directly proportional to the amount of money an
educational system has to teach. In some ways we can’t blame Universities for
charging more if it helps them provide a better education in the end.
	So, as a result of the inherent hard problem of education, the government cannot
physically solve the issue of student debt alone. In this frame, it is our belief that
Universities themselves not only must do more to bring down the student debt ratio, but
the US government must empower universities to solve the student debt issue
themselves, through the creation, amendment, and reformation of legislation that is in
favor of innovative approaches for educational institutions to do so.
Throughout the rest of this paper, we will present a novel approach for a higher
educational system that unites the government and its educational institutions, together,
with its financial markets, through the creation of UniversityDAO, a tokenized University
that aims to end student debt and empower our nation's scholars to truly own their
University.
	With that being said, UniversityDAO is still largely in concept. Much of what is
presented in this paper is subject to change and comes with its risks, assumptions, and flat out flaws. We hope that the readers of this document will come together to not only
critique and absolutely bash the approach we’ve crafted, but to come together in order
to form a more perfect University system that solves the hardest problems of education
we face today.

7028,The Angry Teenagers - scalable decentralised funding for real world reforestation & environmental projects,1,0x3460BF837B6741035d20Ea2D894A4423A859af12,"
We are angry about climate change. We're also pretty damn scared... the future looks utterly terrifying.

Angry Teenagers is a project born out of those feelings.

They are also a reaction to the insidious idea that we need to rely on central authorities - governments and big corporations - to fix the climate catastrophe. That individuals can't make a meaningful difference.

We can, and we must. Blockchain gives us the tools we need to do that. 

When you buy an Angry Teenager NFT, your money goes to a specific, unique square of land and the NFT updates with photos as that piece of land comes back to life as a forest. You see your money making a beautiful change in the world. 

From degraded scrub land with few trees and little biodiversity, to a forest with trees like this: 

[photo: Some of the Angry Teenagers team during a site visit to a pristine forest adjacent to the first reforestation project we are undertaking. This is what we will restore the land back to. September 1st 2022] 

All the funds raised from NFT sales go into a blockchain wallet that is controlled by the vote of the NFT holders. So NFT holders maintain direct control over the work they fund. 

As the forests grow, they generate carbon credits. Revenue from carbon credit sales is returned to the project wallet, and the NFT holders can then vote to reinvest them in more reforestation. This creates a compounding reinvestment loop that means the impact of our NFTs grow over time. 

More and more of this denuded, degraded, lifeless land is restored back into magnificently beautiful, diverse ecosystems. 

The first project we’re funding is a youth organization in Ghana (SYND Ghana) who are training young people to rebuild an ecosystem on land that has been destroyed by intensive logging.


[Photo: the Angry Teenagers and SYND Ghana team talking with the Chief of Nsonyam Ye village about the impact of the reforestation project on his community and their environment, September 1st 2022] 

The first reforestation project is set up and ready to go - including detailed on the ground work with the local community to ensure maximum alignment and mutual benefit. The funds from this grant will allow us to finalise the tech platform for the sale and the voting structure of the DAO.

We also have a pipeline of further projects through which we can scale. 

We are actively talking with other projects in the ReFi space about leveraging the Angry Teenagers technical and legal structure and brand in order to finance other real world projects. 

Everything we do is open source and designed to scale the overall impact of the ReFi space. 


[Photo: Angry Teenagers and SYND Ghana team with the young people of the community who will work on the reforestation project]

Angry Teenagers are about not waiting for governments and big corporations to solve the climate catastrophe. They are about being empowered as individuals and as a community.

We can be the generation that rises to this challenge, individually and as a global community. 

Hear more about what we're doing on the ReFi podcast: https://podcast.refidao.com/e/angry-teenagers-with-ben-an-eline-from-ecomint/

We are also in the ReFi DAO Real World Assets circle. 

Everything we are building is open sourced: form smart contracts to the legal contracts. We have pioneered a legal structure that gives the on chain entity control over the funds, while having a real world entity that hold legal accountability. 

We actively encourage other projects to use this framework to create a funding stream for their real world projects - either as an Angry Teenagers project, or under a different brand, but using the tools we've created.

7162,The Longevity Decentralized Review - TLDR (by VitaDAO),1,0x99B75a632567ce5A86eDE922E23D1B052136192d,"The Longevity Decentralized Review (TLDR) is an on-demand peer review service. Website: https://longevity.review. It addresses critical issues with academic journals:
Researchers should be able to obtain peer reviews of their work in a timely and fair fashion.
Reviewers should have the option of being compensated for their efforts.
The general public shouldn't have to wait for research to be published in a journal to know whether it's credible.
Journals should not profit off the free labor of researchers.
TLDR will not interfere with the status quo. It is an opt-in mechanism for researchers to get extra eyes on their work.


FAQ
How does TLDR work?
TLDR provides funding for researchers to review each other's work. There is a free and paid tier. Articles from websites known as “Rxiv” (pronounced “archive”) preprint servers, BioRxiv, MedRxiv, and Arxiv are auto-posted daily to the homepage. The incentive for peer reviewing these freely posted manuscripts is to receive a share of the donations given to TLDR. See the Donate page to donate. The paid tier differs in that it allows researchers to post their work directly to have it reviewed. Paying places a ""Paid"" label next to the submission. Researchers pay a subscription (see below for details) to keep their manuscript(s) part of the paid tier. Reviewers have extra incentive to review paid manuscripts because they not only receive a portion of the total donations but also a portion of the total subcriptions. Because VitaDAO is supplementing the reviewers with its $VITA token, the initial focus of both the free and paid tiers are on longevity related research.

Where does the research come from posted on the TLDR homepage?
The research is posted from the researchers themselves and from the preprint servers, Biorxiv, MedRxiv, and Arxiv. We especially want people to link to their research on the preprint servers. These ""Rxiv"" websites enable anyone to submit their research in the STEM (science, technology, engineering, medicine) disciplines for free. This is helpful because not every can afford to publish in traditional academic journals. Currently, we are focusing on biology-related manuscripts (e.g., Arxiv ""q-bio"" and ""physics.bio-ph"") but we potentially will expand.

How does peer review work on TLDR and how does it differ from traditional peer review?
TLDR reviewing is similar to traditional peer reviewing in terms of its emphasis on rigor and in judging for importance. However, it differs in that it is quantitative. The ranking of each work is based on upvotes by ones peers. It is similar to how it's done at Hacker News. Also, the reviews are ranked by upvotes. Anyone can review a work by clicking ""Write review"" under each manuscript.

We believe TLDRs have value when compared to traditional reviews because though they will likely be shorter than traditional peer reviews, they can be faster and the voting can enable a broader consensus. This contrasts with traditional peer review that is performed by a relative small number of people (2-4).

All this being said, we are always open to suggestions on how to facilitate a better peer review environment.

How does how the reviews get evaluated affect how they get paid?
Researchers can evaluate the reviews using upvoting and commenting. This feedback will help reviewers grow their reputation and will determine their payouts.

How are donations handled?
TLDR gives the donations we receive to the researchers who peer review. A small fraction of the donations go to operating the TLDR organization, as is needed to pay staff salaries and maintain this website. We use Stripe for our credit card processing and Coinbase for our cryptocurrencies. Please donate here. We support the following digital currency donations:

Bitcoin (BTC): 36DkutW1QKHSiN9xuGakQaaKThWrhTBBRH
Ethereum (ETH): 0x99B75a632567ce5A86eDE922E23D1B052136192d
USD Coin (USDC): 0x3344fcA91ecdBDb7c919Ae91C0a9a8F1d63a1Ab3

Can you log in under a pseudonym? Can people see my activity on the site?
Yes, you can log in under a pseudonym. There's no restrictions on who can use the site. Your reviews and donations are anonymous. All content is anonymous. We feel this is important to promote free expression. That being said, those who are abusive towards others will have their accounts and comments delisted. Also, if you will make a donation or pay for a review using a credit card, we are required by our payment processor to collect your email.

What is the problem that TLDR addresses?
Publishing in journals especially in the biomedical sciences has significant issues. Journals historically provided an important function in physically printing research manuscripts. However, now with the internet anyone can make their work accessible by posting it online. Researchers are now doing this at preprint servers as mentioned above.

The remaining major distinction between a journal and any website on the internet is that journals have peer review. Peer review is the process of scientists reviewing each other’s work to determine if the work is worthy of publishing. In most cases, scientists recommend other scientists with similar domain expertise to a journal to review their work. Scientists then often spend many hours assessing the quality of results and suggesting changes. Often, there can be several rounds of revision.

This is a system that benefits the world that scientists take pride in, with one major issue – The journals do not pay scientists for any of this work. Rather, the journals charge large and growing fees (many $thousands) to scientists for the privilege of publishing in their journals. The journals have little costs because scientists do most of the work for free. This results in journals having massive profit margins. Some estimates have journals outdoing the profit margins even of some of the most successful companies on earth such as Apple.

To recap, the common scenario is scientists pay journals from their increasingly inadequate non-profit funding sources to have other scientists do free labor reviewing for for-profit journals. It is widely acknowledged by many that this is an unacceptable exploitative system that needs to change.

How does the paid tier subscription pricing work?

What are tags?
Tags are keywords and phrases that you can track in preprints such that you can receive emails when they are found. You can track your tags here. We realize you might not want to check this site regularly, so being emailed of your tags seems a solution to that.

How can I stop being notified by email of new reviews on my manuscripts or on manuscripts I've reviewed?
If the new review is on your manuscript, please go to your Projects page to manage your email preferences. If the new review is on a manuscript you reviewed, please go to your Reviews page to manage your email preferences.

How does one get paid to do peer reviews?
You get paid using $VITA tokens. Please include your ERC-20 address on your ""Profile"" when you are logged in. In the future we plan to use log in with a web3 wallet and to do away with the email requirement.

Who developed TLDR? And what does TLDR refer to?
TLDR was created by Tim R Peterson and colleagues. TLDR is an acronym that stands for The Longevity Decentralized Review. Tim is an Assistant Professor at Washington University School of Medicine. The TLDR is not affiliated with Washington University.

What will my Gitcoin donation go towards?
Currently, the proof of concept website, https://longevity.review is purely Web2 with email log-in, off-chain transactions, and data storage. We will use the Gitcoin funds to implement a wallet log-in, storing of the reviews and their associated manuscripts via IPFS or Arweave, and enable voting on the reviews that will determine how much each reviewer receives to be done on-chain. The latter will allow wallets to grow their reputation.

Future plans
To help the DeSci movement more broadly, we are also developing Proof Of Peer Review (PoP Review), https://proofofpeer.review, to accommodate more general biomedical research. Our intent is to make a Web3 version of the StackExchange network by having several sister sites like TLDR and PoP Review where different types of research is being evaluated. One can image, these sister sites using different tokens besides $VITA from other DAOs.

7105,nfty chat,1,0xcCe0AAc6dBe4971ECf5b3dbd13EF93Cb50b379bf,"nftychat.xyz is a web3 chat platform built to replace discord. Our main functions include direct messaging, community creation, and community discovery. You can chat with frens directly or make your own private/token gated community. It is completely free to use and requires no username or password. In nfty chat, your wallet is your identity. Connect to chat. 



Why does nfty chat exist?

Folks building on ethereum need a better communication tool that is safe and secure. The most popular tool is discord, a web2 platform, which is rife with fraud and bots. Newcomers to web3 often get tricked by scammers who impersonate legitimate members. No one can impersonate you when you use ENS and Sign In With Ethereum (SIWE). As long as your private keys are secure, so is your identity. 

On nfty chat, everyone has a unique username that cannot be spoofed. Your private key is your identity. nftychat.xyz is the web3 community chat platform that is weaning people off discord. It is free to use and open to everyone. Ethereum and ENS are our foundation.

Is nfty chat decentralized?

Your username on nfty chat is and always will be 100% decentralized. In fact, there is no way to create a username on nfty chat, you have to bring your own through the ethereum name service (ENS).

We are progressively open sourcing nfty chat. Our widgets are already open sourced and can be viewed here: https://github.com/nftychat/nftychat-widgets.

Though Novestic gained 600+ users pre-product release, it needed a specific infrastructure in order for it to maintain a successful ecosystem that did not yet exist. Thus after years of research and development, Ecare was born.

ECARE, is an Ethereum Combinatorial Auction Rate Exchange meant to facilitate an ecosystem immune to bear-market volatility.

Bear markets are insufficient for token ecosystems operating under Ethereum since ERC-20 tokens in their current forms are mostly used as investment contracts needing consistent investment to maintain their values.

6875,"""Picto Show Shuffle"", An Internet Radio Show and Workshop",1,0xa5fCB4d378bBa04d7C368e245552E002c2Bb6846,"""MTV and Music Production Tutorials in the form of an Internet Radio Show""
Picto Show Shuffle  (an Internet Online Show and Workshop) - July 2022

Proposal Background
Picto Show Shuffle is the brand new pilot multimedia internet show based in Mexico  produced by Picto Show Records (pictoshowsrecords.near) that seeks to aggregate and grow ecosystem community through music in different formats, from music production tutorials and tips from previous projects (Necropalooza 2020, Necropalooza 2021, Break My Heart Festival, as well as the last RAVE the EARTH fest) to make mixtapes and compilation to adapt more user to MintBase.io around the globe via streaming, as well as to encourage the organization of online events to be part of the stream schedule.

Summary
This time we brought to you an official Internet Radio Show in order to make a platform to aggregate and rebroadcast artists we’ve been conecting and collaborationg through the agency in the last 2 years to bring more talent to NxM via music this live show + production tutorials as well as onboarding process (wallets, and airdrop) and also Minting music productions, we would like to organize our pilot of this new brand Internet RadioShow.  

https://youtu.be/9GtjEkq3oUI

“Picto Show Records” is a label/agency that seeks to give a home and aesthetics to internet core music from Mexico and Latam to the world. It can be anything from a DJ video set, to snippets and upcoming material from artists. 



Project Planning
As we mentioned before, we plan to broadcast +10 hours of music videos +20 hours of just music, and production tutorials, all of these during the first 2 weeks of July, in order to get accurate insights on the performance of this project, in the production team we find a lot of value in engaging a community in terms of learning. It’s planned to be broadcasted on Twitch.



 = INTERNET RADIO SHOW (MTV type programs)
 = PICTO WORKSHOP program (Music Prodcution Tutorials and Tips programs)
We plan to start from July 1st, with a quantity of eight programs, which will be minted in the form of a complete mix of the respective program of the day, and in the case of music production tutorials, the samples used will be minted to provide accessibility. Each show will have an approximate duration of 2 to 3 hours and will be broadcast at 12 PM Pacific Time.



How much do we need to fund this?
The numbers are around 470 USD .
We would be requesting:
Music production programs: $50 USD
Inernet and Twitch Hosting: $200 USD
Blog article for local and national distribution and Advertisement: $100 USD
Funds to distribute to the artists broadcasted: $100 USD
Concept artists and direction designs: $20 USD
Total funding requested: 470 USD
Wallet where funds shall be transferred: 0xa5fCB4d378bBa04d7C368e245552E002c2Bb6846
Also, I have recently added more speed to the Internet host so the quality this time is improving for sure. So don’t worry, it will be high quality programs, you don’t need worry for that    .

Rationale
We’re going through key times for growth and adoption of web3. We think this project will ignite the sharing of knowledge in smaller artist to improve and learn more from Music Production and Web3, where we face something that has never happened before: Latinamericans building digital infrastructure for Latinamericans through the globe. We like to think of this project as some of the beginnings of this format.



Conclusion
As already mentioned, this pilot is planned to last two weeks, but we hope to make more editions of this style in the following months, mainly because of the culture that exists around this concept.
The main vision for the event is to expand our values and initiatives to a virtual scale and to give latin american artist an opportunity to promote themselves in a unique environment.
We hope that our proposal is reviewed and accepted and we can make history together. We are positive we can do a whole lot to drive up onboarding for the Near Brand and we look forward to being approved by the NXM family",Valid Ethereum Address. https://youtu.be/9GtjEkq3oUI unable to be reached. 
7636,Psychology Research & App,1,0x6a5341e3Afd085912b8038504EBa5d96e52b513e,"About
	Gravity DAO is a conflict management commons that is emerging from the cultural build of the Token Engineering Commons, to offer Alternative Dispute Resolution services to web3 communities. We are part of GravityDAO - together with my colleague we are building an Observational Psychological Research. We have a weekly meeting on TEC discord server in the Gravity voice channel every Monday at 11am EST.
	Observational research consists of systematic observation. “Systematic” involves a rational and reproducible procedure for collecting data. Data can be collected using a video recording device or a questionnaire. When the study is ready and the research is done, it will be published on an academic platform and Gravity Medium.
	Surveys are one of the most popular ways to find out what people think and one of the most common research methods in psychology. To build our research we needed to focus on specialized articles (from specialized literature). The main intention was to search for articles that talk about mental health in:  work-family balance, remote work, sleep deprivation,boundaries, routine, shared identity, sadness, stress  in personal life and DAOs. 

What do the articles say?
	In the It’s a New Era for Mental Health at Work, digital article, by Kelly Greenwood & Julia Anas (2021) we see that 68% of Millennials and 81% of Generation Z  left their jobs for mental health reasons. When compared to the data collected from 2019, 50% of respondents in general left their roles both voluntarily and involuntarily (34% in 2019 ). “Ninety- one percent of respondents believed that a company’s culture should support mental health, up from 86% in 2019.” (Greenwood & Anas, 2021).

Expectations of the study: 
-informative and applicable for Web3 space 
-the research and our studies will be helpful for many DAO contributors
 -we measure progression over time
 -it's replicable
 -striving to implement psychology in DAOs
 -raise awareness and bring psychologists to the space
 -harmful mental health factors that are work relatable 
 -isolate good practices for web3 and beyond
 -gather preliminary research data that will be used for further developments

The Solution 
	We see psychological tools being used in different areas, especially around Token Engineering Commons (TEC). But our goal is to have this field where we pay more attention to our surroundings either online or in real life and especially to ourselves. Our idea is to bring tools and resources that people will be able to get help from and feel safe if they need to talk to someone. 
	After collecting the results from the survey, the next step is to analyze it and create a free application where: psychological help is offered, guidance to a specialist psychologist, techniques and practical methods in different areas. We consider it ideal to offer our services to other DAOs. Also we want part of the application to have a social function -Where people can talk about how they feel. Only together we can build!


The link to the survey- 
https://gravity.trabalhovivo.net/

Our team 
	We are two women with a background in psychology leading this initiative, involved in the DAO space for 1.5 years. We are enthusiastic about promoting mental health in the DAOs space. Since December/2021 we have been working on the creation of this research: showing our idea of the implementation of psychology in web3, gathering data and articles from different platforms, integrating with the community and finding that our research and desire to provide psychology to the DAO space was needed.
	Together we collected more than 25 references and we got a collaboration with Universidade de Brasília- Brazil (University of Brasilia) to develop the survey and publish the research in an academic way. 
We can't wait to take on new challenges and come up with useful solutions for the entire Web3 community. 


Our journey in Web3 has begun! We need funding for the development of the application and for new future research directions related to psychology and Web3.

The token minting rate is set by whoever builds the biggest political faction. Anyone who wants to control the inflation rate must convince - whether by charisma, bribery or intimidation - other DAObi holders to back their bid for power. Whoever builds the biggest faction wins the right to set monetary policy for as long as that support lasts.



Originally founded as a real-world experiment in political and economic governance mechanisms, DAObi is now a fully functional system with a verifiable track record. Voting currently takes place on Discord and Airtable, with rate-setting being done manually via the CLI. Newly minted tokens are deposited in a Uniswap liquidity pool for public purchase.

The game project and properties are managed by a Wyoming registered DAO, Three Directorates DAO LLC, with all code being open access. We are now raising funds to move the voting on-chain and create a front end to facilitate minting.

The team of Rootmeta (https://app.rootmeta.xyz/) determined to build a safe and easy trusting social ecosystem, based on the function of communication tools, integrated with decentralised technology and the spirit of Dao.

The basis for trust-building in the social network stems from breaking the barriers of information opacity.A TVI (Total Value Island) is designed for the disclosure of personal on-chain assets, which are collected and displayed on each user and communities’ profile through the crypto wallet, become as proof of DID identity.This makes it easier for Individual explorer to Observe if someone is consistent with words and deeds or not and find the most reliable and valuable Influencer and info.

User experiences from two perspective show you how to link more credible crypto world in Rootmeta

Users and communities are the main roles involved in the experience and communication of the on-chain ecosystem. I will show you how to connect the on-chain communication through Rootmeta and explore the future meta-verse from these two perspectives.

As personal unser: obain a free, rich and easy social life at Rootmeta

(1) Easily log in the site with any crypto wallet and to creat your own island or land on any other island which attracts you. There is also no need to worry about harassing messages sent from unconsious-click pages. You’ll get a clean and pure social space and can concentrate on your interests or interacting with friends.

(2) Freely and smoothly swich to other applications in the crypto world through Rootmeta, while chatting with friends and community. No cumbersome clicking to switch pages. No risk of phishing sites.

For community leader: Harnessing the power of community building and sharing

If someone who wishes to extend their influence, they need to fully demonstrate the authenticity of their experience, by showing asset lists or other on-chain badges and markers to prove the authenticity of their experience.

For the founder and leader of the community, Rootmeta offers a variety of tools in the community management to meet the needs of the communicate and carrying out various group tasks in the virtual space. And also designed leaderboard to help them to attract like-minded follower and builders into community, maximisethe enthusiasm of community- building, increase the influence of the community.

And community benefits distributed back to members is also encouraged in the Rootmeta. Rootmeta has set up a NFT as community incentives to encourage the community to create together and improve the TVI ranking. Top 500 of the leaderboard will be rewarded with NFT and other benefits in the future.

Conclusion

Rootmeta is still a rare and bold attempt in the social market today, which integrates the function of traditional social tools with the features of crypto production, still at the beginning of journey to building. But at least it has already shown a true user-friendly intention and determination to clean up the online-social environment. Such a multi-functional social product needs more and more voices from user to help them optimise from the feedback. The future development of product and team is worth looking forward to.

7297,Dolven Labs - DAO Based Ecosystem Catalyst for Starknet,1,0x9C0ac414a8B85321fE88ae5c43399960C5F56Bee,"

1] What is Dolven Labs and How does it work?

Dolven Labs is a DAO Based Ecosystem Catalyst for projects built on the StarkNet Network it is an initiative to empower, accelerate and support innovative projects in the StarkNet ecosystem by providing them with early-stage investment. We aim to be the future of investment, deal flow, and value creation in the StarkNet ecosystem.

About how it works is very simple: We provide early-stage investment to projects built on the StarkNet Network. This process of investment needs to be fair and effective at the same time. Therefore we have Dolven Labs DAO, the projects that apply for investment are forwarded to DAO for voting, and if they receive a majority, they will receive an investment from the Dolven Labs Mutual Fund.

2] What is Dolven Labs DAO and How to become a part of it?

Dolven Labs DAO is what holds the decision-making power in Dolven Labs, like to decide which of the applicant projects will receive an early-stage investment, voting is held and our DAO members cast their votes. The project which receives most votes is then handed out an early stage investment.

The members of our DAO are called Delegates. We use staking to incentivize and reward users for holding $DLV and include them directly in the StarkNet ecosystem. When you stake $DLV token on Dolven's staking platform, you have an option to become a Delegator.




3] How does Dolven Labs plan to be Sustainable?

Dolven Labs is an initiative to empower, accelerate and support innovative projects in the StarkNet ecosystem, enabling them to push their boundaries and achieve their goals. To enable this, we need to implement an investment strategy that can withstand all types of markets. It is important to us that we continue our support for projects in the Starknet Ecosystem not only in a rising market but also in a declining market. 

To ensure the Dolven Mutual Fund continues to invest in projects built on Starknet, we are building tools that hit two birds with one stone. The first bird is Dolven Labs mutual fund, with the continued investment we run into the risk of depleting our investment fund, therefore, we need to add funds to it which brings us to our second bird which is accelerating building in Starknet. 

Building on Starknet can be hard, even with an experienced team the learning curve can pose challenges that can offset your target Roadmap with unforeseen complications. To counter this we are introducing to you our sustainability tools which are designed to accelerate your Starknet experience.




4] Dolven Labs Vision and Roadmap. 

We aim for Dolven Labs to be a go-to platform for new projects in the StarkNet ecosystem for early-stage investment. The strength of Dolven Labs is being transparent and fair to its community with more users joining in, Dolven Labs would effectively become a major player in the StarkNet ecosystem and become a true game-changer. 

Our primary goal will always be to add value to Starknet and facilitate its healthy growth.

7419,Barichara Regeneration Fund – Prototyping a Bioregional Regenerative Economy,1,0xFd9F8A0f4bdEaC72F08AF1c708023cC31dD2E3BE,"About
The Barichara Regeneration Fund (BRF) supports the wholesale restoration of a 500,000-hectare territory in the Northern Andes of Colombia by developing and weaving together a network of individuals and organizations pursuing regenerative work on the individual, social, and ecological scale. Money received will be utilized to continue the ongoing work of the BRF to catalyze on-the-ground regenerative work in Barichara in service to the creation of a prototype of a bioregional regenerative economy that can be utilized worldwide.
 
Introduction


The town of Barichara, Colombia is uniquely positioned to cultivate large-scale regenerative work. Situated on a plateau, Barichara is at the center of a 500,000-hectare territory defined by its own regional climate system. The region possesses an incredibly unique ecosystem, the High-Andes tropical dry forest, that exists nowhere else on Earth with eighty percent of the species here being endemic, only existing in this territory. Unfortunately, the region has also seen intense monocrop agriculture, leaving only ten percent of the native forests intact. This, in turn, has led to soil degradation and erosion, the drying up of rivers, and the loss of the unique biodiversity of the territory.

 
What Has Been Accomplished 


Land and the Ecoversity
The BRF works to restore ecological health through a multifaceted strategy of weaving together current regenerative projects in Barichara, purchasing land for regenerative work, and creating groups and organizations to facilitate this work. Already, the BRF has raised $50,000 to purchase a heavily degraded plot of land, Origen del Agua, and has begun regenerative work on it.

Recently, the BRF has secured a second piece of land, Las Albercas, that will be the future home of the central campus of the Barichara Ecoversity. Here an off-grid campus will be created to provide on-the-ground training in various regenerative techniques such as permaculture, rainwater harvesting, renewable energy solutions, and syntropic agroforestry. The Barichara Ecoversity will serve as an integrating hub for both research and education in the territory with the Las Albercas campus serving as a place for experts and students to gather to teach and learn the skills needed for restoring planetary health, all while cultivating a deep connection to the land.

 

Syntropic Agroforestry
One of the central projects of the BRF has been spreading syntropic agroforestry throughout the territory. Syntropic agroforestry aims to foster climax ecosystems independent from outside inputs with an emphasis on plants geared towards maintaining food for human consumption. This works through the planting of food crops next to support species that aid with water retention, the fixing of nitrogen in the soils, the creation of shade, and the production of biomass to continually provide organic matter to cover the soil and enrich it over time. These methods encourage a process of ecological succession to occur as would happen in a natural process of forest expansion, just much faster and focused on supporting edible species. The process is one of syntropy with increased growth, diversity, density, and complexity throughout the entire system compared to conventional or organic agriculture.

The BRF has supported the creation of syntropic agroforestry projects throughout the territory. A syntropic agroforestry expert was brought to Barichara and has been teaching local farmers within the region. Specifically, two three-day design classes on syntropic agroforestry have been offered, giving participants a technical explanation of the principles of the technique and then hands-on instruction through the creation of two field sites. The demand for syntropic agroforestry has been great in the territory, and our aim is to continue supporting those wanting to learn on their journey towards transitioning to regenerative food production.

Other Work
The work of the BRF is constantly evolving in relation to what is emerging on the ground in Barichara.

A community council was set up to coordinate regenerative action in the territory with funds from the BRF being used to support fifteen local projects in the community, greatly facilitating the development of relationships among these projects in the territory.
As its successor, we are in the process of creating a Territorial Foundation to formally facilitate the reception of funds and mediate their use in a process ensuring consent and support from the local community.

All these efforts combine to form a cohesive and self-reinforcing Bioregional Investment Platform where the individuals and organizations dedicated to regeneration cyclically flow value amongst each other, creating a consistent spinning out of social and ecological value for the entire territory. With your help, the BRF aims to support this ever-evolving process of territorial regeneration.

 

Next steps for the BRF
The work of the BRF has been ongoing for nearly three years, and much has been accomplished in that time. The relationships developed through this work and the land that has been acquired has given the BRF the foundation on which to pivot to long-term strategic planning to ensure the holistic restoration of the entire territory. One of our partners and collaborators, Commonland Foundation, has created a landscape investment framework currently utilized by fifteen territories around the world.



Their model is a five-step, twenty-year process to produce a self-sustaining regenerative economy, geared towards social and ecological improvement. Key to the success of this model is the formation of a core team with enough funds to dedicate themselves completely to this work all throughout the twenty-year period. This initial investment in a core team provides the supports necessary to ensure that the work reaches maturity, and a regenerative economy can form and begin to sustain the entire territory. This core team is currently in development and will continue the work of the ongoing regenerative projects in the area.



The development and funding of this core team forms one of three major funding efforts for the BRF. The second is the funding and construction of the Ecoversity, described above, and the third, the support of the current regenerative projects in the area. These three overarching projects will allow us to move towards holistic landscape regeneration at a bioregional scale. In total, this amounts to raising $500,000 in the next year to accelerate this work. The funds gathered through the Gitcoin grant round will be directed towards this purpose.

 

ReFi Barichara
 

We will also be holding an event, ReFi Barichara, from October 3 to 7, taking place between Cosmoverse in Medellín and DevCon Bogotá. ReFi Barichara aims to be an entirely different kind of Web3 conference. During the event, participants will be able to directly engage with the ongoing flows of an active regenerative economy with field site visits to the various regenerative projects in the area allowing attendees to get their hands directly involved with regenerative work. We will also be holding design workshops centered around applying ReFi tools to the local context as participants connect to these on-the-ground projects. All of this will be held through an emergent process of facilitation as the learning that occurs during the event shapes the development of the event itself. We want to create an opportunity for the participants to learn from a living laboratory of regenerative finance and see how ReFi tools can be utilized in a real community and landscape. In the run up to the event, we have already begun to collaborate with various ReFi groups and organizations like RegenNetwork, ReFi Spring, RegenFoundation, and Celo Foundation as well as starting a learning journey to prepare people from the on-the-ground regeneration space for taking advantage of blockchain technology.

Vision
All the activities of the BRF are in service to the creation of a real-world prototype of a regenerative bioregional economy. By weaving those that are on the ground, purchasing strategic pieces of land, integrating Web3 tools to monitor change in ecological health, and being continually open to new collaborative relationships as they arrive, the BRF intends to lay the groundwork for others to follow in their own territories. We hope that with the success of this model in Barichara, it can be used as a prototype worldwide and help regenerate the planet through regenerating local communities.

Learn More
BRF community council member Joe Brewer has made the effort to document its progress to English speaking audiences. He has formulated his thoughts on the process in his book, The Design Pathway for Regenerating Earth, and founded the Earth Regenerators network, a diverse platform with over 4,000 participants dedicated to restoring planetary health, to spread the model developed here, while learning from others’ experiences. He and others from Barichara regularly provide updates on their progress in videos and articles on the network.

7489,The Floo Network,1,0x9E33078f3398be71da0E0fba182Af22eEA0EbB12,"Crypto, A history

The most successful products built in crypto today focus on finance and trade.

However, in the early days of bitcoin and ethereum, many people dreamed of building user centric decentralized platform for things like uber, facebook, airbnb etc.

The overarching purpose was to increase human flourishing and rek the rent seekers.

These projects all failed.

Honestly we didn’t understand enough about the new paradigm of crypto.

We built a yellow-paper on the internet.

But now we know so much more.

Defi, NFT’s and DAO’s have taught us about how to build in this new paradigm by creating a series of composable building blocks.

Permissionless composition one layer on top of another vs walled gardens one silo after the next.

We now have the opportunity to go back to the beginning.


Introducing The Floo Network

The Floo Network is a building block for the future of composable work.

The simple technicals:

It’s an ERC721.
It has infinite supply.
It has a metadata standard.
It is zero cost.
It has 3 economic incentives ( aka bounties ).
It has an allowlist, and a disallow list.

That’s it. ( on purpose )

Each NFT represents a unit of work.
Every stakeholder has a built in business model.
It makes it easy for all people and systems to work together.

How we see the future of Floo



The Floo Network Roadmap

Deploy v0 to low cost chains and testnets
See current contract progress on github.
Deploy v0 subgraphs.
Improve composability of the 3 core incentives.
Allow people to create things like reverse dutch auctions to incentivize expedient work.
Allow for privacy in a public space via Lit Protocol.Much work is not and should not be public. Connecting access control & encryption allows more types of work to be supported.
Zero Knowledge Permissions
Allowlist and Disallow-list are implemented via merkle root in v0. This is inflexible. Leverage ZK tech to allow improved and more expressive permissions system that follows new standards coming out of Decentralized ID & Decentralized Reputation spaces.
Improve arbitrary ERC20 Support
Allow for rewards in single or multiple tokens.
SDK, React-Hooks, Improve Subgraphs
Build tools that make it easy for application developers to interact with the protocol on the frontend.

On Not Making Money

The protocol will always be free. We are big fans of the hyper-structures thesis.

On Making Money

The people involved in the ecosystem, and the project itself deeply believe humans making money is a good thing. We will build the companies on top of the protocol that are rewarded primarily via the 3 main incentive models of The Floo Network.

Technical Architecture In More Depth

We believe that Kleros ( decentralized court ) is an excellent example of the beginning of what we call “Human in the loop crypto systems”

We believe that essentially all higher orders systems can be composed using a combination of the 4 core interfaces of The Floo Network smart contract:

Permissions
Bounty For Apps who Integrate
Bounty for Completion of Work
Bounty for Recruitment

Important note:

Unlike other NFT’s you have seen. Each NFT has its own permissions and bounties. These are not global to the contract as a normal allowlist would be. Also these NFT’s are not tradable like traditional NFT. They fall somewhere between normal and soulbound with transfer and ownership related to current state of work completion.

Permissions

Allow-lists and Disallow-lists
Choosing who can do work, who can see work, who can’t do work, and who cant see work, is fundamental to orchestration.
Example Scenario:
User takes quiz on 101.xyz to prove they are fluent in Spanish and English. They are awarded an NFT.
User joins DAO
DAO creates work order for documentation translation and limits it to only those who hold DAO tokens and Proof of Translation Skill.

Bounty for Apps who Integrate

Each NFT on The Floo Network is created by a user facing application. Each app needs a business model. The app can charge a small fee per NFT created on behalf of the user.
Example Scenario
Company creates project management tool for DAO’s. They Charge either a flat fee in fiat ( monthly enterprise model ) or a few cents per NFT generated. ( approaches normal SaaS revenue with 1k tasks / month )

Bounty for Completion of Work

Each NFT can includ a bounty for work to be done. This bounty must be deposited at time of NFT creation acting as escrow. This is a way to pay internal contribution directly, or let the open market fulfill your wishes.
Example Scenario 1:
You allowlist members of your company to be the only ones allowed to do and see work for your organization. You provide zero bounty on the NFT because everyone is paid salary. You leverage The Floo Network because it allows all your employees to use whatever tools they prefer because all work is now portable and interoperable.
Example Scenario 2:
You are an organization specializing in accounting but you like to deliver your work with slide decks going over the macro details. All of your employee’s are busy accountants so you contract a small number of people you have built a relationship with to make decks for you. You provide a bounty and an allowlist for these people to complete the work as you need it. You have a general agreement on prices before hand which is how you price you're bounties. 

Bounty for Recruitment

Lots of modern work is facilitated through platforms. It’s how your food is delivered. It’s how we get from place to place. The recruiter bounty is a way to add an economic incentive for someone to find the person to do the work if you don’t know who it should be in advance. This creates an incentive and business model for people to build service DAO’s, labor marketplaces, and platforms on top of The Floo Network.
Example Scenario:
You want to throw a big party so you use an app that specializes in party planning. The app knows how to find the cake, hire a decorator, and take care of everything. Under the hood, little to your knowledge, a company that has built a platform for cake makers, makes its money by connecting that app to just the right cake maker for you by acting as the recruiter for this special skill. Cake makers are happy because they don’t need to sign up for every new platform that comes into existence.

Hooks and Interfaces

The main for interfaces will be constructed with lifecycle hooks that can be subscribed too before and after for side effects inspired by OpenZeppelin hooks & Lens Protocol Modules.

7173,Building the Bridge between Web3 users and Policymakers in DC and beyond: ThreeOh DAO,1,0x136e583B16f724599Dc898DD8B23099260A4931f,"Support the Future of Web3 by Helping ThreeOh DAO Educate and Influence Policy & Lawmakers around the World. 
For the first time in modern history, there is a real opportunity for communities to organize and influence the regulatory framework of a new financial sector. ThreeOh DAO has seized this moment in history to create the first DAO (Decentralized Autonomous Organization) that is mission driven to shape regulatory policy in the United States and beyond on behalf of grassroots Web3 and DeFi users. ThreeOh DAO is focused on impacting the crypto policy on behalf of users. ThreeOh DAO is the voice of the Web3 Community, providing our community and Web3 the opportunity to impact the framework that will ultimately define the parameters for access and exclusion within the new global financial system. 

This is an opportunity for investors to be the change they want to see in the world.

Company summary: ThreeOh DAO is the first organization designed to actively engage policymakers through lobbying and education on behalf of the Web3 community. Through 501(c)(4) relationships with two lobby and policy teams (Fintech and Strategic Communications), affiliated non-profit 501(c)(3), and a Super PAC, ThreeOh DAO has built the necessary infrastructure tasked with the challenge of regulatory policymaking on behalf of the global Web3 community. As referenced in a recent Politico https://www.politico.com/newsletters/digital-future-daily/2022/06/06/a-dao-has-a-pac-and-its-spooky-00037527, 3OH is the only DAO in the United States that has a registered Super PAC.

Mission statement: 3OH DAO strives to become the trusted voice of Web3 to government officials in DC and around the globe.Together, we’ll educate policymakers on the transformative benefits of blockchain technology and work to champion policies to advance the Web 3 community.

Market: Our target audience is made up of web3 users and supporters that are passionate about the sustainability and long-term success DeFi and Web3, and the development of Web3 friendly regulatory policy that fosters and enables growth and adoption. 

ThreeOh DAO serves every organization, token, and ecosystem in Web3. Utilizing a successful marketing strategy from a respected voice in Web3 will seize and capitalize on this aspect of ThreeOh DAO.

20% of the grant funding will be dispersed to our 501c3, DeFi Education. This is an IRS approved 501c3 with the mission of educating policymakers, staffers, and regulatory bodies on the benefits of digital assets and blockchain technologies. 
30% of the grant funding will be allocated for marketing and strategic exchange partnerships. ThreeOh DAO is resolute in its mission to bring the voice of Web3 users to the regulatory tables that are forming throughout the US. Through the use of this allocation, we believe we will be able to attract new DAO membership and increase our DAO's influence over the regulatory processes taking place in Washington, DC. 
30% of the grant funding allocations will be utilized for the formation an International DAO Coalition based in Dubai, UAE, by utilizing Dubai's ""commerce free zone."" These free zones allow for organizations to create international business subsidiaries without the requirement of residency.
20% of the grant funding will be allocated for international marketing and advocacy partnerships. Through our relationship with Runway Strategies, we have access to their international policy/advocacy expert, Joanne Marques. Joanne currently lives abroad and has 20+ years of experience working with international policy and advocacy initiatives. Through the connections Joanne has built, we will be able to connect with governments and DAO organizations alike to create an international advocacy powerhouse with the mission of supporting Web3 expansion across the world.

7192,IMCODING-Offer interactive blockchain programming courses.,1,0x1FB8BcFB78435d661e0db46a67FEA87A854c4039,"
*Interactive programming page style, for reference only

IMcoding is a platform for interactive programming education that blends programming language learning systematisation with the X To Earn mode. To add value to the learning process and improve skill in a relaxed setting. The objective of IMcoding is to encourage more individuals to participate in the creation of the metaverse, with everyone being a creator of the metaverse and exploring Web3.

Immersive learning: Use interactive learning to immerse learners and allow them to enjoy programming.
Value acquisition: By offering learning incentives, IMcoding motivates people to learn.



IMcoding Trouble Shooting

1.Some metaverse users lack more scientific and convenient methods for analysis and on-chain operation

Understanding the code can lead to a better understanding of the project, familiarity with the various mechanisms, and the ability to avoid falling into ""traps"" in the code-first metaverse. IMcoding provides an innovative solution for this pain, in an interactive way of metaverse related programming content output, provides practical cases to tamp personal programming foundation, gradually letting a programming rookie become blockchain engineer, to complete personal programming needs.

2.Improve your skills to advance your career

At the moment, the Web2 employment situation is bleak, and some people are finding it difficult to break out of a career rut. Going from Web2 to Web3 is a great way to advance your career. Specifically, the latest public chain Aptos will be released after the news, brings attraction to whether Web2 or Web3 engineers, the most classic rumour is Move language developers hourly wage of $1200 /h. IMcoding not only provides Move language teaching content, but also a variety of blockchain-related programming language content (such as Solidity, Python, Golang, and so on) to meet the needs of improving personal abilities.

3.When the market is bad, you must learn and prepare
When the market is bad, the chain's activity suffers. People in the metaverse have more time to learn, and IMcoding has a unique incentive mechanism to encourage learners to continue learning, when the next ""bull market"" comes, people will find that personal value and ability will be greatly improved.

7208,Ecare: Ethereum Combinatorial Auction Rate Exchange,1,0x4cd29CAe5305FD386C004fA0c41801356eA09e26,"Artists & storytellers have been living in economic hardship for thousands of years. Before my journey into cryptocurrency, I was running a visual storytelling company for over 6 years (paying the artists/storytellers out of my own life savings). This method was unsustainable for both the company and the artists, thus I was introduced to crypto in 2017 with a spark to solve this financial problem.

Ecare was thus born out of the ashes of a cryptocurrency ecosystem in 2019 created to lift artists & storytellers out of poverty; Novestic. Though Novestic gained 600+ users pre-product release, it needed a specific infrastructure in order for it to maintain a successful ecosystem that did not yet exist; Ecare.

Ecare is the infrastructure created to house an ecosystem to lift artists & storytellers out of poverty. 

ECARE, is an Ethereum Combinatorial Auction Rate Exchange meant to facilitate an ecosystem immune to bear-market volatility.

Bear markets are insufficient for token ecosystems operating under Ethereum since ERC-20 tokens in their current forms are mostly used as investment contracts needing consistent investment to maintain their values.

Token balances rise and maintain value based on exchange rates agreed upon 
﻿further calcifying a self-sustaining token ecosystem absent of consistent investment.

6871,Buckets - save in cryptos with your goals in mind,1,0x3e4D0598887818e53bD4ca542A819385d6bf676E,"Buckets wants to make saving a fun and customized experience with blockchain-based saving games and goal-focused piggy banks.

TLDR
Buckets is a Decentralized Finance (DeFi) app that helps you pick crypto investments that fit your goals. It's all about setting goals, creating a plan, and investing accordingly in cryptocurrencies and DeFi. 

Having received initial funding from Aave (a reference in the space), our four-person team now requires additional financing to keep going. As part of our efforts, we will continue to integrate third-party protocols such as Aave, develop the saving games, and perform a complete security audit of our code base. 

All of this is thanks to your support.

It's up to you what the next few months hold for Buckets! 

We need your contribution to shape our vision of creating better saving habits for everyone. Even the smallest contribution count thanks to Quadratic Funding!

You're awesome! Thank you so much in advance!


---------------------------------------------------------------------------------


The mission
Buckets makes it easy to invest with personal goals in mind. The mission is to democratize the web3 ecosystem and to promote a sound financial discipline powered by DeFi, in a fun way.

There were three main motivations behind the creation of Buckets:
1) Benefiting from smart contracts and the blockchain technology permitting transparent and cheap financial transactions
2) Limiting investment risks, which are too often neglected when dealing with cryptocurrencies
3) Improving the experience for the end-user thanks to on-chain saving games

The protocol
The app has three modules:
1) Goal: helps you define your savings goals using an excellent framework
2) Investment: invest in the best projects and saving games that are suited to your goals
3) Tracking: a best-in-class portfolio monitoring tools

On top of providing decentralization (no custody, protocol integration), Buckets introduces a measure of investment suitability to tackle the lack of risk measures in the cryptocurrency space.

A message from the founder
DeFi can unlock limitless opportunities. Thanks to composability, protocols can combine as Legos to create new features. I am convinced that the biggest innovations remain to be seen, but what we're building with Buckets surely takes advantage of such disruptions made possible by blockchain technology.

This led me to learn web development from scratch 2 years ago and to dedicate all my free time to this project ever since. As a result, I received funding from the Aave Grants DAO allowing me to finalize an initial version Buckets (Q3 2022). We are now 4 people working on the project and are continuously discussing the future of Buckets with our community on Discord.

Further funding is necessary to finally shape our vision of a fun and interactive savings app. When it comes to Buckets, we're aiming for long-term goals, not short-term gains. Creating value for users will always stay on top of our minds!

7196,Collateralizer,1,0x7676B7fC2d1507BF9abFfC4C1CFEc9176e885e89,"Overview

Collateralizer DAO is a non-custodial platform that empowers anyone to effortlessly grow their crypto assets.

It is built on top of decentralized blockchain protocols, offering a seamless way for people to grow, track and control assets right from their wallet.

We, as a project, aim to allow anyone with any level of crypto knowledge to have easy access to the market’s most competitive products and strategies.

How does Collateralizer DAO work ?

Collateralizer DAO integrates the top strategies, staking protocols and more into one intuitive dashboard, providing users with an easy way to earn more out of their assets.

Every strategy has a carefully weighted risk score, allowing everyone to participate on their terms and risk appetites. From strategies based on stablecoins to Bitcoin and a comprehensive range of ERC-20 tokens, our platform has everything users need to secure higher returns on their crypto.

With this in mind, we have made Collateralizer DAO as intuitive and easy to use as possible. To start earning, a user only needs to select a strategy and deposit the corresponding token.

All of our products are built first and foremost to benefit our community, which is why all of Collateralizer DAO’s strategies earn rewards not only for end-users but for anyone that contributes to our platform.

To implement this, Collateralizers DAO requires a 15% performance fee on every strategy. The remaining 85% is distributed to the users, compounding automatically in their chosen strategy’s underlying asset. As an additional revenue stream for our community, Collateralizer DAO administers a 0.5% withdrawal fee when users remove their assets from a given strategy and distributes all proceeds back to veCDT holders.

There are much more details about our project. Due to the limited space, please refer to our website(https://www.collateralizer.xyz/) to find out more information.

7482,Building a Landscape of Voting Contracts,1,0xAbb9aC1F97FB9b40a538B41f7F5e3681d4495bE5,"We propose a framework for on-chain voting that can be grown by a community into a vast landscape of voting contracts. This would be beneficial to the Ethereum ecosystem as a whole.

If there was a system of voting contracts covering a wide range of possible voting types from token-weighted voting via quadratic voting to delegation, then DAOs could simply plug in rather than hard-coding yet another, say, token-weighted voting into their contracts. Plugging in would be as simple as pointing to a deployed voting contract. One can also plug out or exchange the reference from one voting contract to another. In order for this to be possible we first put forth a voting standard as an EIP. Subsequently we deploy a couple of core voting contracts as a starting point. We are in contact with two DAOs who are interested in using the framework and helping us build the system.

**Update** (8th of September):
I have opened a topic on the Ethereum magicians forum to discuss the EIP draft: 
https://ethereum-magicians.org/t/eip-draft-configurable-voting-contract/10736 

**Update** (12th of September):
Your contribution will cover the deployment costs for a first batch of contracts on ethereum mainnet and polygon. We will also deploy a voting playground dapp on Polygon on the 20th of September. Anyone who interacts with the playground will have an EarlyTester NFT minted to them. Watch this space!

**Update** (13th of September):
Working together with the web3 developer DAO dOrg: 
https://twitter.com/dOrg_tech/status/1569398026653020160. 

**Update** (20th of September)
We have deployed our first contract to Polygon. It is a voting contract registry: https://polygonscan.com/address/0x017d53C9CFDb6c79fc4336e5b42749D6171e7098#code
Thanks to everyone who contributed. In the coming days we will also deploy:
a participation NFT (that can be used also for testing)
a registrar for the voting contract registry
a resolver for the voting contract registry
two or more simple voting contracts
a playground voting contract
a badge (NFT) to interact with the voting app
If those things are going well, we will also deploy some contracts to mainnet.

**Update** (21st of September)
We have also deployed the voting registry on mainnet:
https://etherscan.io/address/0xC535389b5a26efEbc27811915B6d78f6C95433f7
It is a central piece of the architecture, so we are happy to have deployed it to the ethereum mainnet.

**Update** (25th of September)
We have deployed the following contracts on Polygon:
a registrar for the voting contract registry (https://polygonscan.com/address/0x19C079de81C1C1C075B0C3D08B66E27398F641b8)
a resolver for the voting contract registry (https://polygonscan.com/address/0x5B6dDD4fbf59Ab342E17946D19ABa88261F3eF92)
The first voting contract (Majority vote with ERC721-token weight and quroum) (https://polygonscan.com/address/0xa7C183bBC8c7522115A7919fF84278Cfc9FF67f6)
The second voting contract (Another Majority vote without token weight but with quorum) (https://polygonscan.com/address/0xa967470C2A65CB6a9C91dAA3eE818370df2CfD82)
These contracts have all been veryfied on polygonscan. Anyone can deploy registrars or resolvers as they wish. The same holds obviously for the voting contracts. There will be more documentation on how to do this soon. (https://twitter.com/VotingContracts/status/1574129755204599808)

7478,Save Pakistan -- The biggest climate crisis 33M+ displaced,1,0x54e0cD76449570BE004A8C1Ad7ab0AB2bb8982c3,"
On-Going floods in Pakistan are the Most Destructive Climate Events of 2022
Pakistan is a Victim of Climate Change!!

Thank you for checking out Save Pakistan.Crypto’s #GR15 Climate Solutions campaign!
 
Pakistan, a victim of a climatic disaster, is fighting for its survival. Pakistan contributes less than 1% to global carbon emissions, yet faces the most devastation. 
 
Currently, 1/3rd of the country is underwater due to monsoon rains that started in June 2022. 

🔥 Summary to understand the Climate Emergency in Pakistan

~Pakistan has become the prime victim of climate-induced humanitarian crisis i.e., monsoon flooding, despite contributing to <1% of the world's share of carbon emissions. 
 
~Over 33M people have been displaced, with more than 1.6M houses destroyed. 
 
~73% of the total flood affectees have inadequate access to basic necessities like food, clean water, shelter, and medical aid. 
 
~65% of Pakistan's food basket has been lost, with over 3M acres of crops destroyed. 
 
~The estimated economic loss is at least $10 billion due to weeks of torrential rains and floods.
 
~Floods have affected Women and Children disproportionately. 
 
~This Fundraising campaign, led by Tayaba Organization and Unchain Fund, will provide relief goods like ration bags, tents, medical aid, food, clean water, etc. to the flood affectees. 



🌏  We are Facing a Climate Emergency of Extreme Proportions
 
These floods have killed about 1200 people, including more than 300 children, since June 2022.
 
Economic losses are estimated to be more than $30bn, 50 million people have been internally displaced, and there is the threat of a malaria epidemic as floodwater lies stagnant.
 
UN secretary general, Antonio Guterres, has lamented that the world is “sleepwalking” through Pakistan’s devastating super-flood. 
 
""$880m was raised in a day and a half after the cathedral of Notre Dame suffered a fire in 2021 but an entire country of drowning poor must beg for climate aid and assistance"" 



🌱  Savepakistan.crypto’s Fund Raising Call
 
In times of humanitarian crisis, the global crypto community has always stepped forward to coordinate giant fundraising initiatives and help the community in every possible way.

7333,Active Blockference: an Open Source Package for Cognitive Modeling in Web3,1,0xa430a62C1c0d469f9Dc6E6944C1cFD9456021e42,"Overview
Active Blockference is an open source package that is implementing Active Inference simulations in cadCAD, with a focus on blockchain and Decentralized Science (DeSci) ecosystems. We are working to develop Active Blockference into a modern framework for cognitive systems engineering in blockchain & cyberphysical ecosystems.
The Active Inference Institute (AII) is a non-profit open-science institute curating and developing applications related to the Active Inference framework. The goal of AII is to produce cutting-edge education and research to enable real-world applications of Active Inference. AII also seeks to scaffold the Active Inference community: increasing the competency of participants & raising broader awareness of these topics.
As the DeSci ecosystem rapidly expands, it will become increasingly important have historical, real-time, and anticipatory awareness for researchers and organizations. This kind of situational awareness will be vital for maintaining public goods such as Science, Education, and social Communities. In this grant we are aiming to operationalize our Active Entity Ontology for Science (AEOS), through the use of the Active Blockference open source package, to enable this kind of modeling.
Active Inference is an approach to modeling cognitive entities which is being applied to many fields ranging from artificial intelligence to communication, trust, and collective intelligence, and regenerative finance. We are building Active Blockference to be a simulation and design package that uses cadCAD to implement Active Inference (ActInf). Briefly summarizing, ActInf agents act to minimize their uncertainty about the world though sensemaking and action, reducing the divergence between their predictions and observations.
Resources to learn more:
200+ Livestreams covering many Active Inference papers and topics
Active Blockference presenting on the cadCAD community call from August 3, 2022
Active Blockference presenting on the SCRF community call from August 25, 2022

Where is the project and team currently at?
Currently, several working Active Blockference simulation notebooks are available, and our all-volunteer project team meets twice weekly. We have been in development on this project specifically for around 1 year, and the Institute has been in operation since the beginning of 2021. We are seeking resources to increase the pace of development, scaffold partnerships, and acquire computational resources.
This project is scaffolded and stewarded by the Active Inference Institute (https://www.activeinference.org/). We are an international team of distributed researchers (currently active contributors to the project include: Jakub, Bleu, Janna, Daniel, Brock, Sidcode, Amit, Shady, Peter, and more.
We are working closely with the cadCAD development team, and using their platform BlockScienceLabs. Additionally we are connected/collaborating with several relevant groups in Web3 (such as Kernel Community), the DeSci space such as OpSci (via project participants Jakub and Shady).
We have been interested to apply Active Inference to the setting of Web3, DeFi, and Decentralized Science (DeSci) for some time now, resulting in our paper from March 2022: “An Active Inference Ontology for Decentralized Science: from Situated Sensemaking to the Epistemic Commons“. In this paper we provided an overview and contextualization of Decentralized Science, and introduced the AEOS framework which this grant will develop upon.
Currently, Active Blockference simulates the cognitive processes and goal-directed behavior of a single-agent. Our goal is to expand this simulation into a multi-agent model, in order to explore the cognition and behavior that drive successful DeSci and DeFi projects. As a multi-agent simulation, Active Blockference would facilitate the rigorous analysis of consensus protocols and Web3 communities prior to deployment. It can serve as a sandbox where we explore the cognitive, micro-economic, behavioral, and decision-making processes of DeFi. Hence, we aim to develop the tooling, use cases (case studies), and educational resources that enable a cognitive audit of DeFi protocols in Web3. The addition of this cognitive layer into the DeFi development stack will facilitate trust in DeFi protocols within the Ethereum community, thus maximizing the value of these projects.

What are the next steps for Active Blockference?


Specify the entity types that are involved in DeSci using AEOS
Create Active Blockference entity models in cadCAD
Compose simulation environments based upon specific use cases
Do parameter sweeps in cadCAD across system and cognitive parameters
???????????????????????????
Have an epistemic commons that works for everybody

This grant we will have 3 main aims and areas of output.
Develop the Active Blockference package to address the blockchain setting with a focus on the social and technical aspects of DeSci ecosystems.
Use Active Blockference to understand behavior within ETH/Web3 ecosystems, including DeSci and DeFi. Here we will complement existing cadCAD simulations and case studies
Improve educational materials, documentation, and public communications (e.g. blog posts) to onboard new people to the Active Blockference community. This will included Low/No Code application running Active Blockference

What would success look like for Active Blockference?
Providing a library/package anyone can build on top of with software affordances (like Git), to enable cognitive modeling & cognitive auditing of epistemic ecosystems in DeSci and beyond.

How does this project benefit the greater Ethereum ecosystem?
The ETH ecosystem is challenged by projects that fail to realize their expectations, due to insufficient consideration of the cognition & behavior of people using them. This can look like the failure of communities/protocols to persist for various reasons, here we are most interested in the behavioral aspects of these phenomena. The Active Blockference package and framework will facilitate rigorous cognitive audits of Economic protocols, epistemic ecosystems (as in DeSci), as well as Web3 communities, during design time and run-time (realtime tools for adaptive organizations).
Implementing Active Blockference within the ETH ecosystem will add value, and scaffold community cohesion in several ways:
We have advanced structural and macroeconomic models for Ethereum in cadCAD. However, there are no entity models for ETH, limiting the usage of behavioral and microeconomic models. These types of entity models could complement structural models, for example by enabling better understanding of the behavioral aspects of cryptoeconomic systems, fostering healthy interactions, planning with foresight, and applying of corrective interventions
While ETH mainnet transactions are transparent for all, explainability is not. Active Blockference will contribute towards explainability via interpretable visualizations, natural language descriptions, and useful simulations.
ETH elaborations: ETH infrastructure is undergoing rapid development and deployment, Layer 2’s, ZK rollups, and other innovations position the ecosystem in a constant state of change that can benefit from the ActInf approaches inherent principles and sensitivities working with cognitive agents acting under uncertainty.
Cognitive Security in ETH: Cognitive auditing — Beyond today’s smart contract auditing (inferring situated, motivated outcomes).
The implementation of an Active Entity Ontology in cadCAD will provide the ETH community with a working model of active and informational agents as well as their affordances (e.g. a smart contract is an informational agent with predefined affordances).
The accessibility of on- and off-chain systems will be facilitated via open source Active Blockference models of cognitive-behavioral systems, permitting validation of ETH protocols using no/low-code simulations.
An open source software package that connects ETH on- and off-chain activity and packages already in use (such as cadCAD) to broader currents related to Cognitive Science. This connection could enable algorithmic project “cognitive audits” to maximize the value of projects deployed on Ethereum. For example currently, smart contracts are statically audited for security (e.g. unintended interactions within/among contracts). With Active Blockference it would be possible simulate a testnet blockchain environment, where smart contracts usage is evaluated as interacting with dynamic cognitive agents. This could result in fewer projects that are viable from a “smart contract security” perspective but unviable from a behavioral perspective.

What is new in your approach and why do you think it will be successful?

We are un-boxing DeSci collaborations through ontology-driven applications of cognitive science and organizational design. Researchers would know what ropes to climb, in order to contribute and succeed in terms of implicit goals.
Active Inference centers the role of intrinsic motivation (motivators such as curiosity and learning, as opposed to extrinisic motivators such as tokens), a crucial factor for DeSci.
Our work will be a solution which can templatized and inherited upon to adapt to different team settings. We are building tools for many kinds of organizations in the ETH ecosystem, not only scaffolding our own work.
Using Active Blockference, we are developing a new open source approach for modeling, evaluating, and designing DeFi / DeSci / Web3 community protocols. The framework of Active Inference will facilitate the cognitive modeling of Web3 system dynamics (individual and collective behavior, funding, treasuries, protocols, etc.) as well as the general Ethereum consensus mechanism.

More details will be added to this grant in the days to come!

7206,Minority Programmers Educational Cohort,1,0x97B882530830a10f07A9f9A733cB7d0491F808Dc,"
Minority Programmers Association is an international network of developers unifying together to build socially impactful software solutions and spread STEM + Web3 education to marginalized communities. 


 
 
Start Of the Program
We originally started this cohort over 1.5 years ago as a way to help anybody looking to get experience in the software industry. It has been absolutely amazing to see everyone go through an unfunded program. Now we’ve hit a tipping point where we need funding to scale our program by hiring additional mentors, more instructors, and to begin providing stipends for students.
 
The Minority Programmers cohort program is a 3-month intensive program that occurs year-round, and recruits on a rolling basis, Students across the world are given hands-on experience working with corporate teams (15-20 hours weekly). Implementing Agile SCRUM methodologies, students use the leading project management tool ClickUp, have tri-weekly daily standups, bi-monthly sprint review, retrospective, and backlog grooming sessions with 24/7 support from mentors and other developers. 
 
Piloted in February 2021, over 100 bright students have successfully graduated from the program with a plethora of relevant deliverables under their resumes. The cohort is highly competitive, implementing a skills test during the admissions process, equivalent to a final project in industry.  At the beginning of the onboarding process, students are taught agile scrum methodologies, get acquainted with the latest technologies like Github, Figma, VsCode, ClickUp, Discord, Signal, ReactJS, Solidity, custom MPA email, etc. students are assigned to complete a 3-month roadmap and SMART goal for the program after which the hiring team evaluates (with consideration to the behavioral interview and where the student wants to be in their long term career) to best place the student in teams and project tasks that give the most exposure to what that student wants to learn. Throughout the program, every student meets with Shot, the President of MPA, to check in on their well-being and to steer the direction of their studies for the next scrum based on what they want to learn. As part of the Sprint Reviews students are expected to present their work for the past sprint in a professional manner, but also to produce video deliverables for those working asynchronously.  As part of the graduation process students are given a custom certificate (to be minted as NFT), a program outcomes review by their supervisor, complete an in-depth exit survey and a reflection worksheet that allows them to easily translate their experience at MPA into resume items. At the end of the program, every student will have successfully worked on large projects (mostly software) with an international team communicating & collaborating when necessary with a handful of deliverables that they can showcase to employers. Shot the President of MPA, a JMU CS/CIS Alumni has even said, “If I were in college doing my program, I would not be able to perform on the level my students do today”. He has said that “Our students not only get tasks done in a timely fashion, but even self organize and share ideas that improve the culture of the entire organization.” MPA is not just a cohort but an opportunity to build a lifelong professional network; they can continue to be involved in whatever capacity with the focus of giving minorities the opportunity to become leaders in the STEM industry.”. A CS graduate, Shot has designed this program to give all positions (even non-stem ones) exposure to the STEM field, with relevant tech stacks that are used in modern industries.

What are the Telos Scouts?

The Telos Scouts are a hybrid of Soulbound NFTs, blockchain education, and good ol’ fashioned community building. We aim to reward your blockchain knowledge and ecosystem engagement with collectible NFT badges! Our collection of NFTs and knowledge they represent pay homage to the stitched badges that adorn scout sashes around the world.

The Telos Scouts is an interactive NFT adventure presented by your friends at Telos Culture. As a block producer candidate on the Telos blockchain, we know the benefits to collaboration across blockchains and want to encourage more people to learn about this growing industry.

Telos Scouts makes it fun to learn about the blockchain!

The Telos Scouts will reward you for completing small tasks that lead up to blockchain mastery. You’ll be able to join us on special episodes of Telos Culture’s livestreams to receive your task and spend time with other Scouters. Come join in on a real Web3 jamboree!

We also know that Telos' strength, along with other Web3 ecosystems comes from a thriving community. So prepare to delve deep into different parts of our ecosystem’s forests and engage with dApps to complete your Telos Scout sash! Telos Scouts will appeal to blockchain beginners and power users alike.

We know that a lot of work is needed to introduce the masses to blockchain technology. So what better way to do it than with a s’more in your hand, a warm campfire, and scouting friends?

As the Web 3.0 industry evolves, many protocols have begun experiments in decentralized ID, social credibility and soulbound tokens. While the Telos Scouts' primary focus is to educate and build community, we also believe that the potential to incorporate soulbound tokens is quite exciting.

This would allow Telos Scouts to evolve into a protocol that can be leveraged as a tool for social credibility, aiding in sybil resistance for the many governance aspects that make up the Telos and Antelope ecosystem. We will open-source this development so that other projects can make use of this certification and identification system.

7242,SpaceFi: A cross-chain web3 platform on Evmos and L2 zkSync,1,0x4C3364502a54c3227f45a14AD6f72bf5877625D1,"SpaceFi is a cross-chain web3 platform on Evmos and zkSync, with DEX+NFT+Starter+Spacebase as initial product. Its ultimate vision is to connect Cosmos and Ethereum Layer2 ecosystem, exploring cross-chain and interoperability solutions.



Inspiration
With the development of multi-chain ecosystem, cross-chain has become an extremely important proposition. From asset cross-chain, message cross-chain to interoperability, with the help of proven cross-chain technology, the modular concept will help blockchain achieve a qualitative breakthrough in performance and versatility, which in turn will drive web3 applications towards popularity.

We were very excited when Evmos was launched. Cosmos is one of the largest cross-chain solution and ecosystem, Ethereum/EVM is the largest blockchain application ecosystem. As the EVM hub on Cosmos, Evmos will connect these two ecosystems. Layer2 is the foundation for Ethereum scaling and modular development. zkSync is one of the recognized representatives of zk-rollup and is compatible with EVM. We believe that Cosmos and Ethereum will be combined in terms of cross-chain and modularity. Therefore, we want to explore cross-chain and interoperability solutions based on Cosmos and Ethereum by deploying applications on Evmos and zkSync.

Because both Evmos and zkSync are new public chains, the ecosystem is in early stages. We want to build a cross-chain web3 platform that integrates DEX+NFT+Starter+Spacebase to explore our vision and incubate more applications, becoming the engine of ecosystem. We believe that human exploration into blockchain and exploration into space originate from the same spirit, so we took space as the theme of our product. In this way, SpaceFi was born.

What it does
SpaceFi is a cross-chain web3 platform on Evmos and zkSync, with DEX+NFT+Starter+Spacebase as initial product. Its ultimate vision is to connect Cosmos and Ethereum Layer2 ecosystem, exploring assets cross-chain and interoperability solutions.

SpaceFi is building a fully integrated system, creating sustainable chemistry between modules. You can trade in swap, earn in farm, mint or stake or sell planet NFTs, create or join a spacebase, and invest in new projects. All of this is connected by SpaceFi tokenomics that combines DEFI and NFT.

DEX: You can swap, add / remove liquidity. Also, trading mining is in the plan. 1/3 trading fee will be used to buyback STAR token.

FARM: In single pool, you can stake STAR or Evmos to earn $STAR. In LP pool, you can stake different liquidity to earn $STAR. In NFT poo, you can stake planet NFT to earn $STAR.

NFT: You can use STAR to mint Common Planet NFTs, 90% STAR burning and 10% STAR allocating to NFT bonus and DAO treasury. Further, you can use different Common Planet NFTs to mint Unique Planet NFTs and use different Unique Planet NFTs to mint Exclusive Star Sign NFTs. Each time you mint, equity assets will randomly increase by a certain multiple.

Staking planet NFTs, there’ll be more rewards than staking STAR token. Also, planet NFTs holders can get bonus from platform fee. In marketplace, you can sell or buy planet NFTs. 5% of the sales will be used as platfrom fee, 70% of which will be used as bonus for NFT holders and 30% will go into DAO treasury.

STARTER: You can participate IDO of new promising projects in public and private pool. Starter will be an important incubator in ecosystem.

SPACEBASE: Spacebase is on-chain community of spacers. You can use STAR to creat a spacebase, 90% of STAR burned and 10% of STAR allocated to NFT bonus and DAO treasury. Both creators and members can get more rewards when they‘re earning in farm.

How we built it
The idea for SpaceFi came from a brainstorming session where we discussed how blockchain would evolve and become popular in the future. We initially focused on celo's financial inclusion and real-world application scenarios in the third world, and conceived the original SpaceFi product based on celo's ""defi for the people"" philosophy. Later, when we came across Evmos and learned about its vision, we realized that the foundation of cross-chain, interoperability, and scalability was needed to popularize the application and improve UE. Therefore, we adjusted our strategy and decided to prioritize building from Evmos. We followed up Evmos testing, and deeply studied Cosmos ecology and Ethereum Layer2 ecology.

In mid-March 2022, we deployed SpaceFi on Evmos testnet, and over 10,000 active users participated. In early May 2022, we deployed the Space Swap module on Evmos mainnet with initial mobility. In June 2022, we built spacefi.io validator on Evmos and guide community to actively participate in Evmos governance, currently ranked 31. In early July 2022, we released partnership with zkSync and launched the testnet, generating 1M transactions in just two weeks and becoming one of the most active projects on the zkSync testnet.

Challenges we ran into
It'll be a challenge to continue the developing on Evmos and zkSync, especially the cross-chain and interoperability attempts.
Tokenomics and the operational data of mainnet. It'll be a challenge to optimize tokenomics to make SpaceFi grow sustainably.
After mainnet we will gradually launch community governance. How to balance efficiency, creativity and community incentives will be a challenge.

Accomplishments that we're proud of
SpaceFi is one of the most active projects on Evmos and zkSync testnet. Many users approved our product and tokenomics and suggested many optimizations.
SpaceFi is becoming a community-driven project, with an community of close to 60,000 members. It's an open, creative and mutual web3 community.

What we learned
We learned a lot. However, three points impressed us:
We have gained a lot from our research on Cosmos and Ethereum ecosystem, and have become clearer about SpaceFi's vision of building on Evmos and Layer2.
We need top-down leading and more bottom-up innovation. Governance is especially important, as evidenced in Cosmos ecosystem. Although governance has many drawbacks, such as efficiency and fraud, it can activate community creativity and bring great value.
Think more, dare to think, and be active in trying and practicing. Hesitation, sometimes lost opportunities, can also weaken creativity.

What's next for SpaceFi
Planet NFT Mint and STAR token IDO, initial liquidity.
Evmos mainnet launch and achieve continuous growth of user data and TVL.
Incubate the first web3 project in community.
Deploy a bridge tool in Evmos and zkSync testnet to transfer STAR assets
zkSync mainnet launch
Connect Evmos and zkSync on mainnet

VISION:

GiroGiroAI strives to build an AI protocol layer that will empower dApps (GameFi/SocialFi/Metaverse) with interactive AI bots to enrich user experiences and help dApps unleash more value with AI. We will also launch a dApp that will help transform NFTs from PFPs into on-chain AI artists, capable of creating generative artworks with the granted AIGC abilities, opening up the imagination of NFT 2.0.
 
DESCRIPTION: TO CUSTOMER PLATFORM 
 
We have three platforms currently in our pipeline of development. The AI interactive platform (shown below) is our first platform which functions as a demo and trial for holders to interact with their NFTs after being granted the AI models. Our later platforms will enable holders to train and upgrade the intelligence of their NFTs through a gamified experience, increasing its NFTs' AI capability and commercial value.


 
DESCRIPTION: TO DAPP AI SOLUTION
 
We've established numerous official collaborations with metaverse projects in which we help to transform NPCs into conversational AI NPCs, helping to infuse more interactive scenarios to increase interactions between NPCs and players and boost in-game playability. By granting the NPCs the capability to remember chat logs and generate conversations with a pre-set personality and background setting, the NPCs can autonomously initiate logical dialogues to help guide newbies, direct players toward in-game purchases, develop potential bonding, etc. NPCs will no longer be monotonous robots.

MSM - men who have sex with men,
DCs - decentralized blockchain-based ad hoc medical councils.

#harm reduction programs - different programs, restraining the HIV transmission from risk groups to general population. Include distribution of free sterile syringes, condoms, etc.

Who am I?

MD, spec in infectious diseases, a researcher in Public Health, charity initiatives creator, science-inspirator (myriad of ideas ;).

7-yrs experience in complex cases curation, including HIV, viral hepatitis, and COVID-19. I was one of the first specialists to describe and publish a study of prolonged (318-days) COVID-19 in a B-cell lymphoma patient (https://www.researchsquare.com/article/rs-750741/v1). For the past six months, I have been involved in the UK-based Bionabu charity initiative dedicated to telemedicine consulting Ukrainian residents and refugees with infections. Having a Master's degree in Public Health Sciences, I became the author & co-author of several research papers in recognized scientific journals such as BMC Infectious diseases, Frontiers in Medicine, Health Information Science and Systems (https://scholar.google.ru/citations?user=k7pjtEoAAAAJ&hl=ru).

Reasoning

Usually, Public Health (PH) is considered a well-established area. However, its policies have low effectiveness despite all the efforts of official international healthcare regulators & a large number of non-profit services. In addition, the lack of widespread tradition of assessing and dynamic re-evaluation of results robs the Healthcare authorities & humanity of completed discoveries and policies. To these accidents we can attribute the famous “hydroxychloroquine for COVID-19” case (the drug is not useful and quite harmful), or “anti-arrhythmic meds always save lives in infarct patients with extrasystoles” (can save from acute deterioration, but increase overall mortality in this population). Talking about researching & reporting flank, we can see a scandalous inability to formulate necessary research questions in big PH-study designs and ridiculous systematic errors in collecting population-level data that negate further study results.

The ongoing competition between scientific groups for resources & journal places that are mainly allocated for the most “positive” findings, combined with research centers' willingness not to lose their reputation, diminishes the capacity of PH Sciences. Hence, independent Public Health initiatives are conducted in a ""detective"" manner if we mean quality evaluations. It is unwelcome for understandable reasons.

That’s why we are here - to create the first independent web3 social ecosystem for Public Health research proposals posting, evaluation and further transparent reporting of findings and well-annotated data (FAIR-data). It will provide an opportunity to conduct collegial motivated study designs reviewing and transparent findings-reporting with rewards for participants via specific smart-contract algorithms.

The main purposes of PH are more than the prevention of diseases and arrangement of medical help on the social scale, it is also in discovering effective mechanisms for communication and experience exchange between professionals. Modern communication technologies as well as significant demand for high-quality medical help give opportunities for decentralized blockchain-based ad hoc medical councils (DCs) and health-technology assessment (HTA). This makes it crucial to attract the attention of public health authorities to the problem of doing such key discussions faster and with more independence & incentive to participants.

PHS DAO' prototype

We propose a DAO with web3 social features for public health specialists, DCs & HTA groups and groups of Social Media & Government relation groups. The community’s repositories will be for different public health issues & corresponding initiatives. All of them will repeat the core repository's structure, consisting of specialists from different sub-fields of Public Health Sciences. The opportunity to ""fork"" the structure of the main repository will determine specialists' easy ""transfer"" between the main and issues-related repositories. 
 
Main actions in such repositories: conducting a study designs evaluation via smart-contract-based voting & rewarding of participants; fundraising campaign in cryptocurrency via DeFi principles; assessment and reevaluation of the conducting studies; creating the non-removable reporting-record. in other words, fast and transparent report of the findings, even if they are misleading - it is important for storage of discoveries with intermediate meaning and negative ones - for further fixing of population's peculiarities, biases revealing, adjusted policies creation. It is very important for thorough meta-analysis and filtering of unsuccessful hypotheses or the circumstances for their realization.

The PH measures suffer from the undesirable meeting of research intentions and redundant centralization. In it Public Health with Charity initiatives are similar. “PHS DAO: Decentralized Public Health Initiatives” give a birth to censor-detached and not mainstream projects but for most vulnerable populations, whose problems are too unpopular to be funded.

PHS DAO' first proposed initiatives
 
There are two first proposed initiatives ready to be reviewed and conducted:
 
1) seamless distribution of antiretroviral therapy in HIV+ refugees population (without any ID documents) with further evaluation of HIV-circulation in it and it's impact for resistant HIV transmission and AIDS epidemics progression.
 
2) decentralized ad hoc medical council for ethics problems in everyday medical practice - target population is medical specialists that work in circumstances of undivided responsibility (https://blog.gosh.sh/p/medical-ethics-and-artificial-intelligence).

Both of them, if will be realized, give not only policies for the target populations (HIV+ refugees and medical doctors), but also a meta-level estimation of HIV transmission, as well as prevalence of ethical issues in different societies.

“Whether we know it or not, without a living ocean, there simply cannot be any life on Earth.”
-Cristina Mittermeier, co-founder of SeaLegacy.org, New Atlantis Founding Advisor, UN SDG14 Ambassador, Instagram 


TLDR
WHAT: New Atlantis is an ocean regeneration project that provides Marine Protected Areas (MPAs) with a viable business model by making marine biodiversity (and life-driven blue carbon)  an investable asset class.  We achieve this by creating an open marine metagenomics biodiversity analytics platform from which ecosystem health can be evaluated and from which blue carbon and biodiversity credits can be generated and sold by MPAs.  

WHY: MPAs are the best way to preserve and protect global marine biodiversity.  Unfortunately, MPAs overwhelmingly lack the resources to adequately protect life in their waters due to reliance on precarious government funding and traditional philanthropy.  To have globally sustainable oceans, the UN estimates we need 30% of the oceans in fully protected MPAs by 2030.  Today, only 2.4% of the oceans are in fully protected MPAs.  Protecting marine biodiversity is critical because biodiverse marine ecosystems 
feed nearly 3 billion people, 
produce 50% of the world’s oxygen, 
are the basis for the global food web
provide an estimated US$29.5 trillion/year in marine ecosystem services
are critical to the ocean’s ability to sustainably sequester vast amounts of carbon via the marine carbon biological pump

HOW: New Atlantis is developing biodiversity metrics to measure + forecast the health of MPAs.   MPAs can use these biodiversity metrics to more effectively manage life in their waters AND  to develop blue carbon and biodiversity credits that MPAs can sell to fund their further operations.  This process creates a sustainable revenue model that scales as MPAs expand their conservation efforts.  

SCIENCE + TECH STACK PROGRESS TO DATE: New Atlantis’ science and dev teams have deep experience in computational biology, AI/ML, data science/engineering, genomics, marine ecology, and development of cloud-based NGS bioinformatics pipelines. Our team has deployed the New Atlantis Living Oceans Metagenome Assembly Pipeline beta (LOMAP) which describes the full genome taxonomic profile and relative abundance of the planktonic species detected in DNA from ocean water samples.  This  creates ecological taxonomic “fingerprints” of the planktonic species present and can be used to gain insights into the structure and metabolic health of planktonic food webs.  Plankton make up 90%+ of the biomass in the oceans and form the basis of marine biodiversity & marine food webs.  

See below or our GitHub for details or to try out our colab notebooks.  LOMAP beta includes the following:

Decentralized Compute on Data architecture for next-gen DeSci workflows using large-scale metagenomics datasets and open AI/HPC scaling tools such as Ray
Stable + reproducible cloud deployments and data storage through open protocols for reliable and scalable bioinformatics use
Unified data platform for translational analysis and model building that enables an ensemble meta-omics approach to development of biodiversity metrics + analyses 

Future developments will focus on cutting edge Next Generation Sequencing (NGS) that enables New Atlantis to scale massive full metagenome datasets while benefiting from declining cost curves in sequencing, storage, and cloud compute.

BIODIVERSITY QUANTIFICATION APPROACH: Quantifying marine biodiversity is a complex challenge that will ultimately require an ensemble of various open  “meta-omics” approaches.  Below is a high level summary of our current thinking.  Healthy marine ecosystems are a global public good.  We invite the global ocean community to collaborate with us to improve our methodology and share in the value created.  

Metagenomics: together with metabarcoding, metagenomics provides the foundational layer for biodiversity quantification of natural environments. Specifically,  detailed taxonomic description and metabolic/physiological potential of ecosystems can be achieved via metagenomics data analysis. See our beta MTG pipeline to learn more.

Biodiversity Metamodel: Based on metagenomic datasets, we will extract a wide array of well established biodiversity indexes/descriptors, which will be used as the starting point for building an open biodiversity metamodel framework. This will consist of an ensemble of different types of marine ecosystem biology models with various capabilities to integrate metagenomics-derived biodiversity indexes/descriptors to compute confidence intervals for outputs associated with ecosystem health, including primary productivity, carbon sequestration efficiency and fish stock productivity.



GR15 GRANT GOALS: GR15 grant proceeds will be used to expand development of our metagenome pipeline, develop initial DNA sampling programs in pilot MPAs, expand NGS infrastructure & support, and help develop open working groups for marine biodiversity standards and metamodel.  


Please consider making a grant to help support our efforts to provide the oceans with a viable business model by enabling marine biodiversity and blue carbon markets.  We would love to give any of our donors a shoutout.  If you want to come build with us, please check out our GitHub, Twitter,  and Discord

ABOUT NEW ATLANTIS 

New Atlantis is an open ocean regeneration project that seeks to address biodiversity loss in our oceans by providing a viable business model to Marine Protected Areas (MPAs).  We do this by building an open marine biodiversity analytics platform to monitor and forecast the health of Marine Protected Areas and from which marine biocredits and blue carbon credits can be generated.  

These credits form the basis of a marine biodiversity market where MPAs can sell credits generated based on the biodiversity, biomass abundance, and life-driven blue carbon in their waters.    This market provides MPAs with sustainable revenue streams that grow as conservation efforts and positive ecological outcomes increase.  By providing MPAs with a viable business model that aligns with their core mission of ocean protection, New Atlantis can help scale marine biodiversity protection efforts worldwide while also enabling massive new markets for ocean ecological assets.  

We are using DeSci-driven metagenomics and related ecological modeling techniques combined with leading edge regenerative finance and web3 collaboration tools to build out the foundation of our open marine biodiversity analytics platform.  

We know this is an enormous, ambitious undertaking.  We don't think we can do this alone.  So we are developing an open, collaborative platform that rewards meaningful contributions from ocean science, ReFi, DeSci (ReSci!!), conservation, and indigenous communities,  as well as from ocean-concerned citizens.  New Atlantis believes there is an opportunity to harness the collective intelligence of the global ocean community to align profit incentives with the protection + regeneration of the global marine biosphere.  

Our goal is to make investing in the protection and expansion of sustainable marine ecosystems an extremely profitable global growth opportunity that can generate financial wealth for humans by improving the ecological health of the oceans.  

We invite the global ocean community to come collaborate with us at discord.gg/NewAtlantis 

#DeSci, #ReFi and #ReSci ftw!

WHAT ARE WE BUILDING: THE LIVING OCEAN PROTOCOL PRODUCT ROADMAP

Please see below for an overview of our product/platform development:

The NEW ATLANTIS LIVING OCEAN PROTOCOL will provide an open, globally scalable marine biodiversity analytics and forecasting framework.  New Atlantis will provide the foundational infrastructure and modular design approach that facilitates open source development, incentivizes community contribution to build collective ocean intelligence, and enables integration of related ocean sciences data + models (ie GIS, metabolomics, proteomics, biogeochemistry, etc)

Phase one of the Living Ocean Protocol is the New Atlantis Metagenome Pipeline Assembly as a platform for scalable marine ecosystem profiling and related ocean analytics + forecasting tools.

Phase 1: METAGENOME ASSEMBLY PIPELINE beta- (completed)  Assess baseline biodiversity of an ecosystem using eDNA (metabarcoding [MTB] and/or metagenomic [MTG] sequencing) data to develop the planktonic taxonomic profile of an ecosystem. This tells us what plankton species are present in what relative abundance.  See the output from the NA MTG Pipeline in Figure 1.  See our GitHub for details and to check out our colab notebooks.

Phase 2: EXPANDING DATASETS/TIME SERIES + ADDING SPECIES-LEVEL MODELS: Add datasets and models focused on the functional traits of individual  species within an ecosystem; enable 3rd party dataset + model pipeline additions.  Productionize direct data collection pipelines.  Begin open development of quantifying marine biodiversity and development of baseline metrics.  
 
Phase 3: INTEGRATING MODELS INTO METAGENOME METAMODEL: Build food web models using  taxonomies + functional traits across species and time.  These models will be both used to gauge ecosystem health (ie preventative health screenings for MPAs) and to make projections about the future growth of those ecosystems.  Expand work on biodiversity metrics including open development of a marine biodiversity unit of account.
 
Phase 4: LIVING OCEANS PROTOCOL MODULAR PLATFORM: enable an open marine data protocol + access to ecological models for broad ocean analytics and/or integration of related modular datasets + models (ie GIS, metabolomics, etc).  Enable cryptoeconomic incentives to encourage 3rd party contribution of datasets and models into New Atlantis Living Oceans Protocol metamodel.  Continuous improvement in biodiversity forecasting + granularity, expanded biodiversity tokenomics.
 
Phase 5: MARINE BIODIVERSITY MARKETS: launch $BLU marine biodiversity token, enable MPAs to generate revenues/tokens by quantifying- and valuing- the life and blue carbon in their areas.  Enable profitable participation by the global ocean community in biodiversity markets/ tokenomics in exchange for providing relevant datasets, models, capital, and conservation work + outcomes.

WHY MARINE PROTECTED AREAS & WHY DO THEY MATTER?
Marine Protected Areas (MPAs) are the national parks of the ocean.  MPAs have been recognized as the most effective way to regenerate life in our oceans,  life which not only sequesters vast amounts of carbon but also serves as the foundation of our foodweb. 

According to the United Nations, we must have 30% of the oceans fully protected in MPAs by 2030 in order to allow for ocean restoration by 2050 and avoid collapse of the food web. 

Today, only approximately 8.1% of the oceans are currently protected in MPAs (and of that only 2.4% is in MPAs with the needed  “no take” or “full protection” status).  The vast majority of MPAs lack an adequate funding model to meet their conservation and enforcement goals due to reliance on often precarious government funding and philanthropy.  Under- and unfunded MPAs are “paper parks” - protected in name only - where illegal fishing, coastal erosion, and pollution continue unchallenged.  We need a better way to incent the rapid creation and sustainable expansion of MPAs.

To meet the UN Sustainability Goal of 30% with real protection by 2030 in MPAs, we will need to 13x the amount of “fully or highly protected” ocean area in MPAs.  The majority of these MPAs will likely exist in the Global South.  Given deglobalization, energy shortages, expected food shortages, and inflation; it is hard to imagine that MPAs in Global South / Emerging Markets will be able to meet the funding needs to 13x effective coverage area.

“I am completely behind New Atlantis for a simple, timeless reason: We cannot “fix” climate change, we can only create more life. That is what we do.” 

-Paul Hawken, environmentalist, author, activist, New Atlantis Founding Advisor 


Without MPAs, the ability of global ocean ecosystems to regenerate is severely limited.  MPAs provide a necessary- and economically beneficial- way for nature to provide a sustainable future for both marine life and for humanity.  Protecting and increasing ocean life protects us all.  

If we protect MPAs, the economic benefits will vastly outweigh the costs, generating new wealth for humanity, as well as providing food security, avenues for new pharmaceuticals, ecotourism, improved fisheries, and protection for coastal communities. 








MARINE BIODIVERSITY, CARBON, & CLIMATE CHANGE: WHY PROTECTING LIFE IN THE OCEANS IS CRITICAL

“Mapping the amount and richness of species and ecosystems, biodiversity, and valuing the services they provide to humanity, including carbon sequestration and storage, must be the base of our new economic systems.” 

-Octavio Aburto, PhD, Professor of Biological Oceanography, Scripps, New Atlantis Founding Advisor


Our world faces twin challenges from climate change and rapid biodiversity loss.  These are both massive risks to the health and prosperity of our civilization as well as the ecological health of the planet. They are also deeply intertwined issues because loss of biodiversity not only reduces our ability to overcome climate change, it also threatens global life support systems like oxygen production, food production, and general ecological resilience.

We are in the midst of a 6th extinction and time is running out.  But if we protect and expand biodiversity (and marine biomass), we can not only save the incredible beauty of our living oceans, we can build a more sustainable and abundant future.

The total value of biodiversity-driven ocean ecosystem services is valued at USD$ 29.5 trillion per year (Ocean and Climate Platform)

So how exactly does marine biodiversity help avoid climate change and provide so much economic benefit? 

Beyond the priceless inherent value of the beauty in our living oceans, marine biodiversity serves humanity and the global biosphere in three primary ways:

Ecosystem Resilience:  As Emmett Duffy, Director of the  Smithsonian Institution's Tennenbaum Marine Observatories Network and MarineGEO program explains, “The more species—or diversity—you have in a system, the more that diversity buffers you from variation in the environment, just like a diverse stock portfolio buffers you from variance in the economy.”  IOW, biodiversity = resilience and we need that resilience to minimize how an increasingly volatile climate impacts our civilization. 

Marine Ecosystem Services: Marine ecosystem services, such as storm or coastal erosion mitigation, viable  fisheries, ecotourism, providing essential food sources for 3 billion people, 50% of global oxygen production, and bioprospecting for new products + medicines are some of the quantifiable benefits healthy marine ecosystems provide and upon which humanity depends.  The ability of ecosystems to function is often directly dependent on the biodiversity of those ecosystems.  Destroy the diversity and the ability to adapt and/or provide those services is also diminished or destroyed.  Ralph Chami, IMF economist and pioneer in the development of nature (biodiversity) markets estimates the value of global ocean biodiversity-driven ecosystem services to be ~$30 Trillion/year.  So, there is a LOT of value at risk if we fail to protect marine biodiversity BUT there is also tremendous wealth to be generated by creating markets that align value creation with marine ecological health.

Carbon Storage + Sequestration:  The oceans are estimated to hold 16X as much carbon as ALL terrestrial ecosystems and soil combined in long term storage.  Additional carbon is sequestered in the oceans (aka ""blue carbon"") primarily thru either the ""physical pump"", a geochemical process where C02 dissolves directly in seawater, or the marine ""biological carbon pump"" where carbon is removed from the atmosphere by phytoplankton to photosynthesize. Because dissolving CO2 in seawater increases ocean acidification, the preferred sustainable and scalable way to sequester more carbon in the oceans is via the marine biological carbon pump.  As life in the oceans increases, more life is fixed in the living bodies of those marine organisms (life is made of carbon).  Those organisms both poop and eventually die.  Their fecal pellets and dead bodies then sink to the bottom as carbon-rich “marine snow”, eventually becoming part of the deep-sea sediment.  In this way, carbon is “pumped” at massive scale to more permanent storage in the deep oceans where it can safely remain for centuries. 


Abrupt changes to biodiversity in marine ecosystems can ripple throughout the ocean’s food chain and affect many other species, including humans. By understanding sources and drivers of marine biodiversity, we can better protect our marine ecosystems, the services they provide, and the ocean’s ability to help us deal with climate change.  Nature in the form of marine biodiversity can be humanity’s partner to help us build a better, more healthy world.

Why Focus on Plankton First?
While they may seem inconsequential, plankton comprise 90% of marine biomass, are the main driver of the marine biological carbon pump, produce 50% of global oxygen, and are the foundation of the global food web. They are also incredibly diverse and provide much of the foundation for marine ecosystem resilience.  Understanding healthy planktonic ecosystems is the key to scalable ecological resilience and the creation of marine biodiversity markets which can value life so that it can flourish to the benefit of all.

Over time, we will expand to include organisms all the way up to whales in our MTG analyses but we are starting with the prime movers of ocean ecology, the small but mighty plankton

“Phytoplankton are the original oxygenators of our planet and are central to sustainment of life in the ocean and on land. The profound loss of oxygen in the oceans is an accelerating condition. It accompanies and is worsened by climate change. New Atlantis vitally centers the oceans - past, present and future - by celebrating the crowning role of our oceans in climate solutions. Through mapping and measuring the interconnected web of our marine life support, we can understand, value and thrive.”

6972,Lenstube,1,0x01d79BcEaEaaDfb8fD2F2f53005289CFcF483464,"Lenstube, an open-source web3 video-sharing social media platform built on top of Lens protocol 🌿 and live on Polygon mainnet.

Creators can upload their content to Arweave and the data is permanently stored on Polygon. With low gas fees, user can post their video content and monetize their content. Also, viewers can support users by minting their favorite content, and tips, by joining the channel using membership, and more.

The problem

Currently, on web2 video platforms, creators have a lot of problems like privacy, censorship, and more. Especially web3 content creators, the channels got banned and de-platformed without warning or any justification. Creators should have a platform where they can own their content and have a direct connection with their subscribers or members.

Solution

We aimed to develop a decentralized video sharing app, where content creators own their video content. By storing videos permanently in Arweave and the metadata is stored permanently on-chain, no one can restrict users from creating content of their choice. Creators can always monetize their content with various means like nft modules and tips.

7576,Project Toninas: Lahille's bottlenose dolphin as a coastal sentinel,1,0x1aC6a323322F3Dad7B7E286d57b6a654cb2a46d1,"Yaqu Pacha Uruguay is a civil non-profit organization dedicated to implement and promote projects for the protection, conservation and study of aquatic mammals in Uruguay and South Western Atlantic ocean. 

One of the main projects is the Toninas Project) carried out since 2002, regarding the research and conservation of the recently recognized subspecies Lahille’s bottlenose dolphin Tursiops truncatus gephyreus (known as “Tonina” in Uruguay),  along the Uruguayan oceanic coast, an endangered species of the Southwestern Atlantic Ocean. This project addresses population ecology, social and acoustic behavior, habitat use and movements of Lahille’s bottlenose dolphins along Uruguayan oceanic coast. 

Since 2018, Yaqu Pacha Uruguay has collaborated with Brazilian researchers in the Gephyreus Project. The goal of this project is estimating the total abundance of Lahille's bottlenose dolphin in southern Brazil and Uruguay and assessing its risk of extinction (founded by Yaqu Pacha Alemania, total granted 2021 for Uruguayan counterpart $5000).

Our last project (2021-2022), funded by Eccosur (https://eccosur.org/, grant received: $10.000 USD) was “Lahille's bottlenose dolphin the coastal sentinel: tourism, environmental education and integrated management”. This project involved a vulnerability analysis of climate change effects on Lahille’s bottlenose dolphin, as well as a promotion of the species as a sentinel and flag species of the Uruguayan oceanic coast. We engaged educators and schoolchildren in various areas of the country, mainly on the coast, tourist operators and other local actors in environmental education activities to increase their awareness of the problems faced by the coastal system due to the effects of climate change and in particular, to see their effects on the Lahille’s bottlenose dolphin. 

In Uruguay, the Lahille’s bottlenose dolphin population is small (approximately 70 individuals), has a restricted distribution and is extremely coastal. It also has a high residence of photo-identified individuals, and high mobility tiwaters of the Río de la Plata estuary and southern Brazilian waters, where there is a high mortality in artisanal fishing nets. In addition, this population belongs to the same management unit and evolutionary unit with the dolphins from southern Brazil, showing low genetic diversity. Due to all of the above, the dolphin was included in the list of priority species for the conservation of the National System of Protected Areas of Uruguay. The results of the investigations also contributed to the recognition of this dolphin as a subspecies and for its evaluation by the IUCN in the Vulnerable category. Although very little information exists on possible direct and indirect threats to the subspecies in Uruguayan waters, contamination from agricultural effluents could be a source of concern due to the pollutant load detected in other marine organisms in areas of high occurrence of Lahille’s Bottlenose Dolphins. Reduced prey availability caused by overfishing and destruction of benthic ecosystems due to fisheries are other possible threats for the subspecies in Uruguay. Incidental capture of Lahille’s Bottlenose Dolphins in fishing gear in Uruguay is rare. However, in the last 2 years at least five animals were recorded  stranded, two of them with bycatch signs from fishing nets located 300m from the coast (“subsistence fishery”).


Our main priorities are:

To resume systematic boat surveys between La Paloma and Punta del Diablo (principally Esmeralda-south to Cabo Polonio) for photo-id and acoustic records. Catalogue update. Population monitoring
To make a new abundance estimate on the Uruguayan coast as well as other population parameters (survival, births interval, movement patterns, residency). 
To get in depth about effects of Climate Change in dolphin’s occurrence and distribution.  
To test hypotheses regarding occurrence of dolphins and coastal upwellings.
To continue coordinated efforts with Brazil, focusing into whistle analysis, specially of signature whistles and catalog construction, social structure analysis and individual movement analyses.
To start studies regarding contaminants levels in tissues of dolphins.
To biopsy samples for genetic, social structure and forging ecology studies.
To include anthropological perspective for historical data of occurrence of Lahille’s bottlenose dolphin in Rio de la Plata Estuary.
To monitor mortality (Stranding network)
To promote citizen science: records of dolphins by citizens  all along the Uruguayan coast (https://www.arcgis.com/apps/dashboards/f4521a13d27045909d4d994d82a872c8).

To keep visiting local schools in order to engage schoolchildren in environmental education activities.
To keep raising awareness of the effects of climate change on the Lahille’s bottlenose dolphin population and the importance of conservation of the coastal marine ecosystem.


Benefits to the DeSci community


1. As one of the first Latin American projects in DeSci, we will contribute to enhancing awareness of the DeSci movement across these latitudes, which will promote its expansion and increase its diversity.

2. We will also contribute to opening DeSci to other different disciplines rather than biotech/biopharma.  Opening DeSci to conservation biology projects will also promote DeSci diversity and the inclusion of more descientists and different perspectives.

3. We will demonstrate the efficiency of quadratic funding as an alternative way of funding often underfunded projects such as those of non-profit, independent, research groups working on conservation biology and focusing on climate change effects on biodiversity.

4. We will explore blockchain technology to build up shared databases of photo-id and whistles catalogs between other research groups working on cetacean populations.","Valid Ethereum Address. https://eccosur.org/, unable to be reached. https://www.arcgis.com/apps/dashboards/f4521a13d27045909d4d994d82a872c8). connection successful.

7454,Saving forests in Colombia with KOKO DAO,1,0x7f722b8b013Ac7Bd654B3B102Acc7573A32DB9bc,"    Mission

   KOKO DAO is on a mission to reduce deforestation in Colombia 🇨🇴. ReFi 




   How?

  KOKO DAO works closely with the local communities to create viable economic models as an alternative to deforestation. 





  Why? 

500 hectares of forests are deforested every single day in Colombia. 
Increasing deforestation in protected areas like national parks. 
Small-scale deforestation is causing ecosystem fragmentation.
Solutions to forest preservation like carbon credits are not a sustainable economic model for small-scale forests. 




In KOKO DAO, we believe that the hardship and resilience of rural communities can be transformed to heal nature as long as we provide them education, stability and women leadership. 




    Pilot project 

We will test KOKO DAO's model on 37 acres of endangered forest in Huila, Colombia.




    Why GitCoin Grants?

Carbon credits are not economically sustainable for small scale forests, they require forests of at least 400 ha.
GitCoin Grants gives us this fantastic opportunity to raise funds and build a community, to keep developing and testing our solutions where preserving nature is our top priority.

    What the funds will be used for: 

Recruiting team for product development, marketing and social media management.
Education and work on the ground with local communities and environmental leaders of the region.
dMRV technology implementation in our pilot project: 15 hectares of native forest in Huila, Colombia.
Biodiversity inventory, research and endemic plant nursery.

Our intention is to create an open-sourced web3 platform (dApp) to enable these workshop leaders and participants to create NFT representations of their physical art and to introduce the participants to the world of web3 in general. From de-fi to privacy protection, web3 is where workshop participants can find the tools they need to further practice self-sovereignty, self-determination, and self-efficacy.

As an example of a session, we will explore past (and recently recurring) trauma, putting it on canvas through color, energetic mark-making, drawing, and then overwrite those using artistic expressions that bring the creator peace or catharsis.  Self-expression and expelling traumatic events via physical manifestation are dynamic tools in building an individual's sense of control, identity, inclusion, and visibility.  Each person will paint, draw, scrape, scratch and  get the traumatic event on the canvas one way or another, and then layer over it or incorporate it into the final piece, much like we must incorporate grief into our psyche in order to keep living healthily after a loss.   

It sounds intense as it’s written here, and parts of it may be, but we will teach real skills and techniques in a way that is playful, fun, exploratory, easily accessible to people with no previous arts experience, and completely non-judgemental.  Our hope is that through numerous interactions over the course of a year, people will feel empowered and understood in new and important ways.  

The United States is the most dangerous country in the world for women, in 2022, according to world population review.   Intimate partner violence (IPV) results in 1300 deaths and over 2 million injuries in the US, ANNUALLY.  75% of those deaths occur when a woman attempts to or has left.  
1 in 3 women worldwide has been forced into sex, beaten, or otherwise abused by their partner.  Domestic violence affects women of color disproportionately, especially severe physical violence.  Black women are the most likely to be beaten severely and to die from domestic violence in the US.  
Women between the ages of 18-24 are the most likely to experience domestic violence, followed by teens between the ages of 11-17.
This is when you look at the statistics of what is REPORTED.

“Getting away is a mother fucker. It is dangerous. It is TERRIFYING. I know because I've done it.  

My ex-husband tried to kill me by pushing me down a flight of stairs to a concrete floor in view of our 4-year-old son. 

My daughter's father, a different man, dragged me out of bed by my hair, broke my finger, choked me, and squeezed my jaw so hard that I could barely open my mouth for 4 days. While I was pregnant. When I finally got him out of my house and had a restraining order, I woke up to him standing over me as I slept after breaking into my home. He was not arrested, despite the restraining order. 

Therapeutic art has been one of the most powerful tools in our recovery.” - Maaike 

Programs exist but aren't sufficient.
There are domestic violence resources to leave. There are escape plans.  There are advocates who will guide you through the court process.  These resources are stretched thin as paper and require call after call to access them.  You know who can’t make call after call and get return calls?  Women who are living under the thumb of a domestic terrorist. 

There are countless recovery programs for abusers that are paid for by the government and, usually, court-mandated. In addition, there are endless free (and paid) recovery/rehab programs for addiction to alcohol, drugs, sex, gambling, and eating disorders, including many 12-step meetings across the US daily for these issues.
   
For people who have experienced abuse, recovery programs are few, not well structured, and underfunded. As a result, you often find people with good intentions running a circle of stories centered around the abuser (codependent behavior) that often turns into the suffering Olympics rather than focusing on the woman, her progress, and her well-being.  

Getting and staying in an abusive relationship results from not having a clear sense of self and firm boundaries. The red flags that typically occur long before abuse escalates to becoming physical would end the relationship for people with healthy boundaries. The problem with never having had any agency over yourself is that you don't understand that LEAVING is the correct response to abusive behavior or that you even have that as an option. While ending the relationship and respecting yourself is the right answer, no person alive can do those things if they don't know deep down that they CAN and have an intrinsic power over their own life. People who are raised with a lack of autonomy simply have no idea about personal boundaries, let alone how to apply them. Sometimes they don't even understand that a person who is hurting won't just decide to stop. 

To be clear - abusers are 100% responsible for the abuse they dole out. There is no BLAME for the person who is abused.  

People need to be taught how to move forward, and there is a glaring lack of help. To work their way up to leaving an abusive situation or to rebuild themselves after they have left, they need to discover their identity away and apart from the negative patterns of abuse, likely all they have ever known. This is the space we aim to fill.

In the curriculum we are outlining, the most important thing is developing a sense of self and the absolute value of each individual's perspective, expression, taste, and message, all of which happens in the inner world.

Neil Gaiman said, ""The one thing that you have that nobody else has is you. Your voice, your mind, your story, your vision."" 

In my opinion, sparking the imagination of the inner world of an individual and repeatedly affirming the value of their voice is one of the most revolutionary things you can do, especially for someone who is being or has been oppressed. What happens inside of us belongs only to us. 

Funding will go toward:
Curriculum development
Space and material costs for in-person workshops for women and children
Filming demos and video editing for online use
Creating a web3 platform whose functionality will include 
Managing the workshops
Onboarding participants to web3 by helping them understand web3 better and get a digital wallet if they don't have one.
Creating NFT collections (using Unlock Protocol on Polygon) representing progress throughout the workshop. They will ultimately end up with a history of their process from start to finish, a story of their healing.

Future Goals:
Additional curriculum material from a diverse group of artists - ongoing
Gain widespread adoption of the curriculum for use by domestic violence services and individuals nationwide
Create a variation of the curriculum to be used with kids as a DETERRENT to domestic violence
Broaden the potential benefit to people who speak a wide range of languages beyond English
Additional goals will be added as they become clearer

Maaike Fettah, Founder
Personal History & Experience 

I have been painting since 1995. I am a self-taught artist, gathering information and skills from a few college classes, a handful of online courses, YouTube tutorials, extensive reading, and art evaluation, and just DOING it. 

Painting has been many things to me, but it has been most relevant to therapy and life. I believe that art in all its forms is one of the most powerful means of personal transformation and restoration. While my current art practice is primarily about bringing beauty and joy into a world that can be very harsh, I have used art to process grief, build my sense of self, and exorcise traumatic events and their memories.

I started in oils and worked sporadically in that, aerosol,  and other mediums as a means of self- expression until 2010.  At that time, I began to use art to process trauma, specifically domestic violence and rape.  The art therapy techniques my son was taught  after witnessing his father try to kill me, were essential to his recovery, and led me down this path.  I began working in acrylics/mixed media and found a magic I had previously only known through making music.  I have also worked in watercolors, primarily in 2011 and again in 2019, when we were in Morocco, during which time I created an entire body of work - 30+ pieces - over a 5 month period, and solidified my desire to move toward being a full-time artist.

In my opinion, abstract and emotional expressionist art is a profoundly impactful form of visual communication that allows both the creator and viewer to be moved in profound ways. My current work explores vibrant color, texture, shape, movement, and storytelling by imbuing the canvas with energy and emotion. 

The most significant history of my past and current work can be viewed on my Facebook page https://www.facebook.com/iMaakeArt.

I have a degree in Mass Communication and Journalism with a minor in Psychology which informs my understanding of visual communication. In addition, I have studied brain and behavior correlation and taken a deep dive into PTSD, trauma, and recovery from it.  I have taken several courses in Group Therapy and believe what I learned about group dynamics will be an asset.

My track record connecting seemingly divergent groups of people through art and music spans nearly 3 decades. My career as a financial planner speaks to my ability to communicate complex ideas in an easily understandable way, manage numerous relationships simultaneously, network broadly, and steward resources responsibly. I am accustomed to floating between groups of vastly different socio-economic and cultural situations with consideration for all and an eye to my own internalized biases. 

Currently I am the Chief Alchemist and Art Director of Sunshine Alchemists & Soap Co and Night Sun Candle Company, businesses I have founded over the past 7 years, as well as an artist. We employ women coming out of domestic violence and give them flexibility and support to maintain financial solvency while remaining available to their children. Receiving funding for this project will enable me to shift further into community healing and art and free up finances to create additional employment opportunities there.
  
I have lived a great deal of life, which has given me a tremendous amount of compassion.  My parents were Christian fundamentalist pastors with a church and school in Montana. Our family lived in the abandoned forest service building that also housed the church and school.  We showered at the Y across the street.  There was no real kitchen.  Our power was turned off regularly.  I know what it is to live out of a gym bag and rely on the kindness of others for food. I had my first job at 12, out of necessity, touching up frames in a factory. Thankfully, my path also led me to live in the Bay area, New York, here in New Mexico, and to spend time in New Orleans and Miami, with people from all over the world. 

 I have learned that how I was raised and what I thought was normal was far from it and that unlearning is an intentional process which is ongoing.  I have lived through… way too many violent incidents of varying natures, and as Lin-Manuel Miranda says, “Wrote my way out.” 

Angela Steffens, aka wonderwomancode
Co-founder Personal History
As a woman who has had a long career in tech, I'm excited to be involved with a project that I feel will significantly impact bringing more DEI to the space. But, more importantly, I am confident it will reduce the suffering caused by domestic violence and hopefully it will reduce the numbers by ending what can sometimes be generational patterns. I started my career more than 20 years ago when I graduated with a degree in computer science. Since then, I have worked as a full-stack developer, architect, consultant, engineering lead, and founder. As a result, I have the skills necessary to help bring organization and coordination to this project to ensure the funding received is used as efficiently as possible and to guide development on the web3 platform in a way that will see actual results. I've been involved in the web3 space since 2018; currently, I work for a web3 protocol, belong to many DAOs, including several others with a focus on DEI, and serve on the board of advisors for several other web3 companies.",Valid Ethereum Address. https://www.facebook.com/iMaakeArt. unable to be reached. 
7450,eth-auth | Ethereum user authentication tokens for dApps,1,0x9eC285EeC188F0EbFa9f88Da4807bE5b049fc049,"Overview
eth-auth is a secure npm library for password-less user authentication on node.js dApps by signing an outwardly unpredictable dynamic JWT token with the user's Ethereum private key.

Architecture



Highlights
Decentralised (Web3)
Anonymous - User identity covered to dApp governors and the rest of the world.
Password-less - Your Ethereum private key is your password, and it won't reveal to anyone.
Breach-less - According to the eth-auth authentication architecture, no need to store meaningful user data in a database.

Installation
Add eth-auth as a dependency to your project.
npm install ethauth-server

yarn add ethauth-server

Setup

Function
const ethAuth = require('ethauth-server');
let key = ethAuth.generate(""ETHEREUM_ADDRESS"", ""ETH_AUTH_SECRET"");

Code sample
const express = require('express')
const app = express()
const ethAuth = require('ethauth-server');

app.get('/get/:address', (req, res) => {
    let address = req.params.address;
    let key = ethAuth.generate(address, ""ETH_AUTH_SECRET"");
    res.status(200).json(key: key);
})

Sample output
{
    ""key"": ""eyJhbGciOiJIUzI1NiIsInR5cCI6IkpXVCJ9.eyJuYW1lIjoiZXRoLWF1dGggdG9rZW4iLCJhZGRyZXNzIjoiMHg5ZUMyODVFZUMxODhGMEViRmE5Zjg4RGE0ODA3YkU1YjA0OWZjMDQ5IiwicmFuZG9tVG9rZW4iOiJaTFRuMk1URkJnWndCNWJGQ3l3MnZMWHdPTFFIejBCQiIsImlhdCI6MTY2MjE3OTkwOH0.uQIG0MnYdJ2jcXQQdxtBy78DtjBZSArqFfsZ3uP6H4Ijson""
}
use ether.js library to sign the fetched signing key in your front end.

Validate Ethereum Signature
As the second step, We have to verify the Ethrerum signature from the backend.

Function
const ethAuth = require('ethauth-server');
ethAuth.validate(key, signature, ""ETH_AUTH_SECRET"")

Code sample (Express.js)
const express = require('express')
const app = express()
const ethAuth = require('ethauth-server');

app.post('/send', (req, res, next) => {
    let key = req.body.key;
    let signature = req.body.signature;

    ethAuth.validate(key, signature, ""ETHER_AUTH_SECRET"").then((validation) => {
            res.status(200).json(validation); // true
    }).catch((err) => {
        res.status(401).send('Unauthorized: Invalid signature');
    });

})

Authorized response
{
    true
}

Unauthorized response
Unauthorized: Invalid signature

7361,REGEN LEAGUE:  PAPARIKO - RESTORATION OF DEGRADED MANGROVE AREAS IN KENYA,1,0x96C40f954e8Fbdbc369Dc79A0883Ba816b103179,"This grant is part of the EDEN DAO experiment to use quadratic funding to fund planetary regeneration. Learn more about this radically open experiment here. This project is being developed and championed by Vlinder Climate @vlinderclimate because of their exemplary impact.

How does it work?
“Papariko” project is restoring degraded mangroves sites in Kwale, Kilifi, and Tana River counties, in Kenya. Vlinder is working closely with a local partner company, UMITA limited, and the Kenya Forest Service to create a healthy mangrove ecosystem in degraded areas, starting with planting in 2022. In addition to carbon sequestration to mitigate climate change, the project also addresses environmental issues such as reducing the risk of natural disasters, promoting biodiversity, and linking forest fragments. An expected number of 1500 ha degraded mangrove areas on the Kenyan coast are restored and replanted. In the first project activity up to 138.000 mangroves will be planted in an area of 50 hectares in the Shirazi-Funzi complex in Kwale County in 2022. In the following three years, the project will expand to Kilifi and Tana River County. The species selected for this reforestation project are indigenous and local, namely Rhizophora mucronata, Ceriops tagal and Avicennia marina. The project will sequester an estimated 760,105 tCO2 over a period of 20 years.
Project page on Verra: https://registry.verra.org/app/projectDetail/VCS/3660 
Project page on Vlinder: https://vlinder.store/vlinder-kenya-blue-carbon 

Why did we choose this project?
During the last 60 years, the forest cover in Kenya has dropped by 40%, losing about 12,000 hectares annually. Poverty is the main driver for deforestation, as people have to rely on charcoal for cooking and have to clear forests for agriculture. Mangrove ecosystem is an outstanding choice for restoration: storing 5x more carbon than terrestrial forest and up to 40x times faster sink, protecting the shore, and serving as a food reservoir for local communities. The project is designed in a way that 50% of the carbon benefits will be shared to local stakeholders and communities, contributing to alleviation of poverty and long term ecosystem stewardship.

What is the impact of additional funding?
Mangrove restoration will increase soil carbon content and soil nutrient levels, improve water quality, increase fish populations, improve biodiversity, and provide other important ecosystem services. 
Grant funding will contribute to: 
purchase of the planting bags (1’000’000 are needed to establish a nursery for 2023 planting; each costs 1 KES, $0.00833);
establishing a baseline for biodiversity measurement (20 monitoring sites, 15 permanent sites + 5 control sites; 50 enviroDNA kits are needed, $150 for each kit, including delivery and lab analysis).

How do we verify the impact?
This project is independently verified according to the CCB and SD VISta standards (Verra). The Climate, Community & Biodiversity (CCB) standard identifies projects that simultaneously combat climate change, support local communities and conserve biodiversity. The Sustainable Development Verified Impact Standard (SD VISta) is the leading standard for certifying the real benefits of social and environmental projects.
In addition to standard Verra certification, Vlinder implements full project area drone monitoring, measuring of the SDGs, conducting annual biomonitoring using eDNA of the water samples, focusing on changes in biodiversity overall and additionally on species classified as endangered on the IUCN Red List.",Valid Ethereum Address. https://registry.verra.org/app/projectDetail/VCS/3660 connection successful. https://vlinder.store/vlinder-kenya-blue-carbon unable to be reached. 
7354,Arronia,1,0x03B5867bA7B619d619ec1292d13015CAB5B79d31,"Overview



Arronia is an extensible and modular DAO implementation built around small working groups called pods. It enables DAOs to implement pods. Pods offer users a clean and easy-to-use UI to create and approve proposals within a small working group and allow DAOs to create organizational structure. From users’ perspective, Pod is a clean an easy-to-use interface for multi-sigs. Under the hood, a Pod is a Gnosis Safe with a light governance wrapper.



Arronia’s Pods help solve the issues of DAOs being either decentralized or organized, but not both at once. Pods/working groups help organize otherwise sprawling DAOs, enabling them to maximize member contributions and leverage member expertise.



Arronia enables DAOs to create small working groups based on expertise. Pod membership is represented with ERC-1155 tokens. Therefore, membership is non-fungible and can be made non-transferable ( to unqualified addresses).



Pods can set custom rules to determine membership. They can be gated through hand-selecting trustworthy community members, various token staking requirements, or other methods and metrics.

Pods are modular, so they can be created to fit the specific needs of each unique DAO. They can also interoperate or work independently, and attach or detach from each other in a lego-like build.

7377,BETTER,1,0x0F7272F8873B68b2a2F52685311822D831afC8b4,"TL;DR: 

BETTER is building a web3 movement for planet positive impact 👋 🌎 Because Earth is non-fungible. So let’s not burn it.
 




Web3 is great. Now let’s try and make it to web4.

Climate change is the single greatest challenge of our time, yet the narrative that surrounds it has caused many people to tune out and feel powerless that they can truly make a difference.  Introducing BETTER .  Launched by a team of creatives whose track record includes working with the likes of Nike, Google, Facebook, The North Face, and more, BETTER aims to turn that upside down. 





Climate Impact

BETTER gives its community members a tangible mechanism for creating planet positive impact IRL through the BETTER CLIMATE FUND, which is controlled by the community through a DAO.  Our growing list of Climate Advisors helping to steward the best possible use cases for the Fund include policy and strategists from Climeworks, Climate Resolve, and Toucan. 🤝 

As the first use case, BETTER has partnered with Toucan Protocol to purchase and retire carbon credits. NCT tokens will be purchased, redeemed, and retired in a single transaction to realize offsetting on behalf of the Fund and DAO. 🌎

The future of the BETTER CLIMATE FUND is in the hands of the community, meaning it could expand into any number of different areas including conservation, new forms of tokenized climate impact credits, individual donations to compelling causes, and more. 🌿

For more info on how the BETTER DAO powers the BETTER CLIMATE FUND, please visit our gitbook.  For more info on our team and advisors, please visit our website.




Q3-Q4 2022 

🌿 BETTER BUDDIES, our first collection of planet-positive NFTs, will launch post-merge on the Ethereum blockchain. Ethereum allows us to reach the largest audience in our mission to drive climate impact via web3, and the merge to PoS will reduce Ethereum’s energy usage by over 99%. 

🌎 BETTER merch collab is in progress with Everybody.World. The fully sustainable upcycled clothing line was launched by the former head designers of American Apparel. 10% of sales will be returned to the BETTER CLIMATE FUND. 

🎬 BETTER DAO PSA: Members of the DAO from the entertainment industry proposed creating a public service announcement (PSA) to raise awareness about the urgency of climate change with the call to join the BETTER DAO to take action. Supported by director Daniel Stessen (Dream Corp LLC on Adult Swim and in development at Bento Box Ent. with John Krasinski and The Office co-creator, Stephen Merchant) production from Miniac (clients include Adidas, Lululemon, Mirror and more), and editorial/VFX executed by Revel. 

Why Gitcoin Grants?

Grant funding will assist in Development, Business, and Marketing.  Current funding needs include:

✅ Film Production costs for BETTER DAO PSA
✅ BETTER BUDDIES NFT smart contract development, backend support, deployment fees
✅ Audit of existing smart contracts
✅ Web development including enhancements to BETTER’s off-chain mini game Climate Chaos! The Game
✅ Fixed business costs

We propose a standard for Tokenomics design, including Tokenomics Modeling Language (TML) and a development framework. TML is a Domain-Specific-Language, with declarative specification and formal verification. On top of that, the development framework is graphical, which can also be compatible with existing platforms, eg. Remix, Hardhat. 

What's more, BlockModel has a built-in property-driven automatic economy analysis tool. The tool is easy to use and precise. With the help of this tool, a Web3 team could make accountable decisions while managing their project.

Last but not least, we believe our Tokenomics-Insight-as-NFT mechanism will be good for empowering Web3 collaborative R&D ecosystem, improving the sustainability of Web3 ecosystem. Creators of valuable tokenomics insights could be rewarded well, which stimulates more insights.

Brainstorm, if you have any good ideas, please join us and we will help you make it happen.

How we works

For the whole community, there are three types of people, they are the managers, the developers and the community members. We have created a sub-section of the community to share your Web3 ideas and anyone can post your comments on it. Ultimately the community will vote to chose a project that the community agrees to develop.

For developers without a good idea, TheWeb3DAO is a great place to find innovative ideas.

For brainstormers without development skills, TheWeb3DAO is the place to find  partners and, of course, technically gifted developers.



The first landing platform developed by the community, TheWeb3Portal, is now live. TheWeb3Portal is a Web3 navigation site for all users and Web2 web developers. TheWeb3DAO members will help the front-end deployment of traditional Web2 websites on IPFS to achieve decentralization and integrate the deployed websites into TheWeb3Portal website for users to search and access.

The future we expect

What we look forward to in the future is an increasing number of members joining our community, including developers of all kinds. Everyone will be able to freely discuss development projects in their own subsections.

TheWeb3DAO will set up a special fund to help incubate good projects.

7390,Knowan - decentralized data for better sexual & reproductive health outcomes,1,0x16e3cd34D685E9af1a76eccc3FcB5951233379F2,"At Knowan, we are leveraging web3 to equalize access to data - building a platform that enables the sharing of data or data services in the context of the numerous and varied challenges faced within the sexual and reproductive health (SRH) space around the world. Specifically, we are focused on how data and data services can support High Impact Practices (HIPs) – a set of evidence-based family planning practices vetted by global experts against specific criteria and documented in an easy-to-use format (www.fp2030.org/hips). In fact, data is one of the 5 key focus areas of FP2030.  (see our Lite Paper with more information here:  https://knowan.notion.site/Lite-Paper-Work-in-Progress_v1-2654c63eeeb942769f32bc081126d2d8)

(1)  A trusted, decentralized data-sharing platform, powered by an existing open-source data exchange protocol (Ocean Protocol), that enables the sharing of data and data-based services with a focus on the sexual and reproductive health sector.  For sensitive data, data providers would have the option to specify what part of the data sets others can access and which not. And, it would allow researchers to run AI algorithms on a data set without ever obtaining direct access to the data. This protects the privacy of all the individuals contributing to the data set while at the same time giving valuable insights that might lead to the creation of many improvements - including better AI-powered services or improved treatments for women't health challenges or diseases/STIs; and

(2)   Because the data and the platform itself will not ‘lift people out of poverty’ – Knowan must focus on the users of the data to generate insights that can turn into action to improve data outcomes. We would do this through a DAO structure - with governance, treasury, strategy, voting, and growth led by the community. Through this organization, we can leverage the global community of SRH experts, technologists, data scientists, community workers, advocacy organizations, health providers, donors, AI experts, and individuals - really anyone in the ecosystem – to organically learn, earn, and innovate together to work towards solving this challenge.

Knowan seeks to lay the infrastructure and frameworks for more effective and coordinated disseminating, exchanging, and sharing data by governments, international organizations, donors/foundations, civil society, research entities, the private sector, and individuals. By doing this, Knowan seeks to enhance accountability, improve policy making and service delivery, and increase business opportunities. We will enhance accountability by enabling the use of data to improve policies with data-driven decision making and more effectively advocate for increased funding with supportive evidence. We will improve policy and service delivery for women and girls by enabling the leveraging of data to ensure more transparency, supply chain improvements, quality use of social media for education, enhanced research capabilities and sharing, and improved cost savings through efficiencies. And, we will increase business and economic opportunities – enabling more data for fem-tech startups, improving products, ensuring cost savings, and increasing the production process. And we will rely on our growing community to create and champion those additional solutions and protections that only those with lived experiences and a unique understanding of the issues can champion.

Finally, by creating a space in web3 and data science that is focused on solving issues affecting women and girls, and emphasizing participation by those with lived experience in solving the issues, we will support them in their journeys in the web3 and/or data science. This will provide the additional benefit of educating and encouraging more participation by women and girls in web3 and data science.

As a social enterprise, the funds will be used to support building the ecosystem - with a specific focus on building the platform and completing an upcoming pilot in Uganda. 

We envision a world where sexual and reproductive health inequalities are a thing of the past!  We would be honored to receive any support in our efforts!",Valid Ethereum Address. https://knowan.notion.site/Lite-Paper-Work-in-Progress_v1-2654c63eeeb942769f32bc081126d2d8) unable to be reached. 
7554,ECHO - decentralized comment widget based on Arweave,1,0xe87A5B03Eaf8723E2498Ea07F2Fa2E5dF8C4eeee,"ECHO is a widget-based product based on Arweave to help collecting comments, likes, dislikes and receiving tips.

ECHO can be embedded into any websites supporting iframe including Mirror.

ECHO in Mirror screenshot: 




Mirror entry url: https://orangexyz.mirror.xyz/Nv9FZ9G4OweAJzNnaPFooScS5kGk2M46MSAwqiIyZYQ

Our Vision

ECHO kicks off in this spring. The initial idea is to build a more reliable comment widget with Arweave, which helps us to make data reliable, decentralized, persistent and censorship-resistant.
During this year, we witness the rapid growing of Arweave. Arweave’s vision is to store documents and applications permanently, and ECHO is here to preserve our opinion on anything in the world.

About “ECHO”

When we comment on a thing, we call it an echo; when someone make a response to the comment, maybe a thumb-up, it is also an echo. 
In Shell and PHP, echo is also used as a command to output the strings that are passed to it as arguments. 
The word “echo” presents voice, and also response. We want ECHO to record them all.

Our Slogan

Individual’s views are ignored in recorded history. However, History should not be just about the thing but also the thought. Our opinion is a part of things. Saving our views, emotions, likes and dislikes permanently equals capturing the moment forever. 
With internet and blockchain, it is possible for experience and thoughts of our current era to reach far into future. That is, time fades, but views live on.
That’s why our slogan is Long live our opinion.

We Need Better Tooling

The following comment widgets are popular.
Disqus
https://giscus.app/ (Github discussion)
twikoo.js (Self hosted)
https://utteranc.es/ (GitHub issue)
https://github.com/gitalk/gitalk (GitHub issue)

There are some obvious problems with these tools.
The data does not belong to the person who made the comment or obtained it.
Accounts in centralized services, like GitHub, may be banned due to geopolitics.
Self-hosting on a server has cost and technology barriers.

ECHO is designed to solve these issues.
Each comment will be uploaded with signature of user.
Wallet and data can’t be deleted or modified.
It is an out-of-the-box solution.

Key Features

Decentralization

Decentralization consists of three aspects: decentralized authorization, decentralized data and decentralized front-ends.
Users sign into ECHO with a decentralized wallet. It means you can sign and upload data to Arweave with and without using a front-end page. The related SDK will be released as open source later.
Arweave is a decentralized solution for archiving data. We will provide multiple official gateways and open source our codebase. We also encourage the community to set up your own gateways. Any gateway will synchronize valid data uploaded by other gateways.
Our front-end code has been deployed to ipfs. You can use any ipns gateway to visit our widget.
Besides web3 products, we encourage non-web3 or non-dweb products to use our widget.

Opinion Aggregation

ECHO uses target_uri to identify the comment target. We have designed a set of url schema to identify different objects. Users may comment on the same object, such as a NFT, on different websites and apps, but as long as the target_uri is the same, the corresponding comments will all be displayed.
The followings are some examples of schema.

dweb/ipfs/{cid} // ipfs page
dweb/ipns/{path} // ipns page
database/imdb/{imdb} //  movie
database/isbn/{isbn} // book
https://{path} // http url

Multi-chain Login and Tip

ECHO supports MetaMask (EVM chains) and Phantom (Solana). If you log in with MetaMask, we will retrieve and display reverse record and avatar of your ens or .bit.
The comment target of the following widget is https://0xecho.com.

Fee
The price to store data on Arweave is less than $2.5/1G at this point (2022-09-01), which is cheaper compared to annual fee of Amazon S3 in the long run. The data in ECHO is lightweight text-based. We use Arseeding to upload data to Arweave regularly.
Each user gets 200 uploads per day for free. If there are changes we will inform you. These free uploads are able to cover most people’s daily use. You will feel at ease just like using Web2 apps, when you make comments or thumb-ups via ECHO.
Also, to avoid abuse, a wallet with non-zero balance is required.

Out-of-the-box Solution

The iframe embed widget is easy and hassle-free to get in our website. 
Modules are configurable.
Theme color is configurable.
DID to receive donations is configurable. (.bit and ens are supported)

7113,"Stand up for privacy, free speech and open-source software",1,0x862D5740ceE0eA75530024b3C11ceAf08756AF12,"Last week’s arrest of Amsterdam-based software developer Alex Pertsev threatens to create a dangerous precedent, as developers could now be made responsible if software they created is misused.

Open-source software – which was published under free licence and can be used by anyone and for any purpose – has always been a major driver for innovation in the tech sector. Many popular products, such as Linux, Mozilla Firefox and VLC Media Player, were developed as open-source software.

Open-source software products have millions of users globally, while thousands of developers use open-source code in their projects. Open-source software is flexible and secure, as it can be audited, fixed and improved by anyone.

Now, Alex is being accused of creating open-source code that was used by Tornado Cash, a project under investigation in the US and Europe. But a developer has no control whatsoever over how their open-source code is subsequently used.

Therefore, the accusations against Alex threaten to kill the entire open-source software segment. No one will dare to write and publish open-source code, no one will invest in the segment if they could be made responsible for the use of the tool they created by other parties.

To stand for developers’ right to create open-source software, you need to act NOW!

Help to free innocent person and make your impact in the future of open-source development!

7117,Nimi.eth,1,0xdE81d67Af572EC0F22841da702C1EdC25608dBBB,"

Nimi is a decentralised social aggregator that lets anyone create, curate and share their web3 profile page and host it on their ENS domain! All your socials, NFTs, POAPs and more - hosted effortlessly on your ENS domain.

Nimi started as a hackathon project at ETH Amsterdam 2022. The basic idea behind Nimi was to make it easier for users to host content on their ENS domain! Currently Nimi could be thought of as a “Linktree for web3”. But that’s just the beginning! We want to act as your web3 connector - aggregating all your favourite parts of web3 and hosting them on your ENS domain!



Web2 & Web3 support

Share anything from your Twitter profile to your NFTs, your POAP collection and a growing number of 3rd party integrations

ENS made easy

Hosting content on your ENS domain is hard. We abstract it all into an intuitive, 3-step UI.

How it works

Nimi combines ENS, IPFS, and Limo to let anyone host a decentralised profile page in just a couple of clicks!

#1. Connect your wallet to Nimi. It checks for any ENS domains owned by the address
#2. Claim your Nimi profile. Let it auto-populate or add your own description & extra fields
#3. Nimi builds your whole site on the backend and uploads it to IPFS, with your ENS content hash pointing to it
#4. See your new profile page on [your ENS name].limo in minutes

Of all ENS domains that currently have a content hash set, 5% are Nimi pages! We had over 600 new Nimi pages setup just in July of 2022. This resulted in a large spike of total ENS content hashes being set for the month of July: https://dune.com/makoto/ens

What we will use the funds raised for:

We are looking to always add and improve on-top of Nimi, by adding functionality and improving UI / UX for the user. Some current items on the roadmap are on-chain friendship connections between profiles, adding custom links, enabling in-person connections at conferences with Nimi QR codes, aggregating social content - and much more!

Our main goal is raise awareness of hosting content on your ENS profile, by getting more users in the ecosystem to host content on their ENS domain.

In our latest release (15th of August) we added the following features:

7159,TeaParty,1,0xE8efD33Bf739900E99B015461FfeEb26E967247C,"TeaParty is a Web3 Social growth tool designed to empower the Social-&-Earn (S&E) economy by enabling individuals to amplify their content to outreach to a greater and wider audience.

Regenerative CryptoEconomics
Social-&-Earn (S&E) is a positive-sum initiative that is categorized under Regenerative CryptoEconomics which creates positive externalities that focus on public goods that deliver coordination on positive social impact, which in turn produce fruitful, meaningful, and rewards to any parties involved.

What problems does TeaParty solve?
Problem 0 — Coordination failures. TeaParty’s positive externalities are to create a social growth tool with open-accessible to every ethnicity without prejudice with the goal to cultivate an environment that is safe and promotes inclusiveness for everyone.
Problem 1 — Degenerative economy. In TeaParty, we advocate for a ""Regenerative Economy"", where users who want to be part of Web3, can feel safe and spend little or no money at all but can start to earn revenue with effort and low risk.
Problem 2 — High barrier of entry against huge marketing budgets from corporations. In TeaParty, we elevate and help every starting entrepreneur, content creator, developer, indie game creator, musician, or literally anyone who struggles to get their words out about their awesome creative works.
Problem 3 — Fake engagement/impressions. In TeaParty, every business can reach directly to real users that organically interact and share their content, absolutely different from how the old Web2 ""advertising model"" works.
Problem 4 — Ineffective and non-transparent marketing results. TeaParty will solve that by providing a transparent and cost-effective environment for spending in making your content discoverable. Pay only if any users like or share/retweet. Else, nothing is paid!

Sybil resistance: Proof of Social
TeaParty is taking the ""Green Pill"" by Owocki and commit to bring public goods. 
Combating the Sybil attack issues in Web3 is one of our main initiative.
Introducing our initiative: ""Proof of Social"", an approach that is permissionless and trustless in Sybil resistance.
This approach will be deployed in the form of a smart contract, making it resilence and tamper-proof against any external attack. 
In terms of permissionless and trustless, ""Proof of Social"" data and functions are publicly accessible by any parties on the web to consume and validate themselves.
The smart contract is open-sourced to ensure the public could fork it and use it on their own version.

Entering the Decentralized Society (DeSoc)
Just about few months ago, Glen, Puja, and Vitalik released a Whitepaper regarding “Decentralised Society: Finding Web3's Soul“. It is related with what TeaParty is all about.

Indeed, Web3 today centers around expressing transferable, financialized assets, rather than encoding social relationships of trust. What we trying to achieve here is mentioned by @pujaohlhaver, a ""Bottom-up Coordination"" and creating a co-determined sociality, where souls and communities can come together to co-create plural network goods and intelligence.

How will the funds use?
Development for Proof of Socials in combating Sybil attack
Fund the operation cost for TeaParty platform
Fund the gas fee of transactions for social activities on our platform
Further improvement of the development tools in TeaParty
Improve the aesthetic design aspect of the overall site

7496,Option: Governance for Profitable Good(s),1,0x4f8c531df3d97c6Cd437aC8DfE756975445D1161,"👋 Read the Github version instead, Gitcoin's format is hard on the eyes.

Alternatively, I'll read it to you, with commentary: https://youtu.be/RARKiBnN3us

Option is the fruit of seven years of work to design an economic system that can price externalities. 

Funding from this grant will be used to employ a research lab in characterizing the behavior of Option via direct proof and simulation. In particular, the research lab will focus on the subproblem of judicial selection.

If you’re interested in this project, you might also like to support Digital Gaia’s Grant (disclaimer, Connor is a team member there, too). Digital Gaia is also working on a credible way to price externalities, starting with climate externalities. We need as many people working on this problem as possible.

What's Option?
Option is a prediction market for governance. Communities that use Option enjoy an environment where it’s profitable for companies to do what’s considered good by the community.

Why use Option?
For consumers:
It's easy to choose products that are aligned with personal values and beliefs
It's easy to express personal values in a way that will change companies' behavior

For companies and entrepreneurs:
It's easy to identify which socially responsible action would be beneficial to take
It's easy to earn revenue for social goods that would otherwise require grants to support

For journalists and researchers:
It's easy to be a high integrity researcher or journalist
It's easy to find funding for exploring the most important open questions

For citizens:
It's easy to influence policy in an area of interest
It's easy to ignore politics without bad things happening

For communities:
It's easy to find and form communities of shared values
It's easy to make collective choices

How does Option work?

Prediction Markets for Policy Setting
Option is a prediction market for governance. Prediction markets have long been considered an effective way for groups to make more accurate collective inferences. The basic way a traditional prediction market works is simple: Anyone can create a market. Like, “It will rain on Thursday.” Then other people can bet on the outcome. If the market maker says it rained then the people that bet YES get paid, otherwise the people that bet NO get paid.
Due to the value of accurate predictions, many prediction market platforms have sprung up such as Augur, Metaculus, Manifold Markets, among many others. Each of these platforms are excellent at aggregating information and incenting accurate predictions, however, they cannot be used for governance. This is because traditional prediction markets suffer from three shortcomings that prevent their usage as governance tools:
Moral Hazard — The ability to bet on a particular outcome can create bad incentives. For example, In 2021 a man bet $50,000 that there would be a streaker at the Super Bowl, then he put on a leotard and became that streaker.
Hidden Information — Since earning money is dependent on having special knowledge, betting markets incent proprietary information and insider trading
Policy Impotence — Even if a market offers a very accurate prediction, there’s nothing to ensure policymakers will listen to it or interpret it correctly.

Option circumvents these shortcomings by taking away the opportunity for upside from an accurate trade. In Option, it’s free to be right and expensive to be wrong. This counterintuitive choice allows Option to redress the shortcomings of prediction markets for use in governance. For example, this design choice solves certain kinds of Moral Hazard: if the man in the leotard had known the best that could happen is he wouldn’t lose $50,000 he never would have put on the leotard in the first place.

Option automatically sets its policies based on the predictions of the market. So, when a player bets they don’t expect to be paid for accurate bets, instead, Option players make bets in exchange for shifting the market prediction, and therefore shifting policy. This solves Policy Impotence: predictions in the market directly set policy.

Since Option doesn’t have to pay out for accurate bets, it can instead use that money to pay for information that lead to resolution of the prediction. Standing “resolution bounties” indicate the most high value places where a player can provide information. This solves Hidden Information: players are paid for information.

The details of the mechanisms that power Option are beyond the scope of this grant (if you’re interested you’ll find links at the end). However, it’s worth being familiar with the two general mechanism sets Option uses:
the Claim Market
the Semantic Market

The Claim Market’s job is to encode beliefs as currency. It gives us:
Sincere signaling of belief and values
Bribe resistant currency
Targeted funding for research and journalism
Negative money that’s not debt

The Semantic Market’s job is to instantiate the game for collective inference and policy setting. It relies heavily on the guarantees of the Claim Market. It gives us:
A surface to interlock claims (enabling conditional predictions)
Increased influence on more testable predictions
A way to select unbiased judges for each prediction
Game theoretic policy setting

Setting Policy
Let’s look at a specific example of where regulation was used to try to solve a problem, and how it would have looked different had Option been used. Note that this doesn’t try to tell you why this happens, just describes the behavior.

In 2013 New York City proposed a ban on sugary drinks larger than 16 fluid ounces. The argument by the Board of Health was that the limit would improve public health and make it easier for people to reduce their caloric intake. The argument against this ban was that it would be legal overreach, and it violated the personal autonomy of consumers.

Had New York City citizens been able to use Option, those who wanted to avoid unhealthy drinks would have experienced an increased price for the drinks (akin to a tax) dissuading them from purchasing. In exchange for this tax, Option's prediction that avoiding sugary drinks improves health outcomes would lower the effective healthcare costs of those that opted in to the tax.

As a second order effect of this system, soft drink providers like PepsiCo or CocaCola would find aggregate demand drop for the goods predicted to be unhealthy, incenting them to reduce the health implications of their products.

In this way, Option maintains individual autonomy while localizing individual responsibility; using markets and preferences instead of legislative bodies.

Externalities
But, what about situations where members of a community are harmed by the actions of a company that they don't buy from?

For example, what if a mining operation leaches toxins into a nearby river, which harms a biodiverse ecosystem and degrades the health of locals? If those locals don't purchase products made from the mined minerals they cannot exert influence by boycotting the goods, so it would seem they don’t have market-based ability to minimize the pollution.

Those familiar with economics will recognize that this is a classic example of a negative externality, a “bad” thing that doesn't have a cost associated with it. In this case, the locals and the ecosystem are harmed but the mining operation doesn't pay for that, so they enjoy artificially high profits. The mining company has socialized costs while privatizing gains.

The Shortcomings of Regulation
One option to solve this problem is regulation. For example, the local government could say, ""No more than 0.010 parts per million of arsenic in the water, otherwise we'll fine you 1 million dollars.""

However, regulation has some well known problems:
Regulation is often slow to respond — markets outpace and outmaneuver the regulators
Regulation is often imprecise — it over or under regulates, stifling innovation or permitting great harm
Regulation is often non-dynamic — it doesn't update with new knowledge
Regulators can become ""captured"" — the entities they should regulate find ways to influence the decision in their favor

Coasian Bargaining
Economic theory offers a clever alternative to regulation called, ""Coasian Bargaining"". The idea is named after Ronald Coase who won the Nobel Prize in Economics for this and related ideas. What would Coase recommend to these people whose river is being polluted?

Unfortunately, his recommendation is very unpalatable to most people. He would tell them to pay the mining operation to pollute less. The mining operation could agree to implement policies to reduce their pollution in exchange for the community paying them to offset the costs of implementing the policies.

However, Coasian Bargaining has proven rarely useful in practice. Even apart from the fact that it feels bad to pay people who pollute, and that it could create a net incentive to pollute more so as to be paid to do less of it, there are more fundamental issues:
How can the community know how much it actually costs to reduce pollution?
How will the community verify that the company is implementing the policies effectively?
How do future generations pay for the benefit of a healthy ecosystem and community?

For example, what if the community is willing to pay 2 million dollars to reduce pollution by 50%, but:
The mining company says, ""It costs us 5 million dollars to reduce pollution by 50%"" when it really only costs them $2 million.
It costs 2 million dollars a year to run the water quality tests which confirm the company is complying.
Future generations, when asked, say that looking back they would have been willing to pay $50 million for a healthy community and ecosystem, not just $2 million.

Now you can see why Coasian Bargaining is of limited application, it only works where:
There's no hidden information about costs.
It's easy and cheap to validate performance.
The people who are affected are able to pay.

Option's Coasian Bargaining
How does Option get around this? Option still uses a form of Coasian Bargaining, but rather than pay the mining company to pollute less, Option allows the local community to put negative valued money into the mining operation’s digital wallet. This forces the mining company to negotiate with the community. In exchange for this ability, the local community makes predictions (which they stake) that the mining operation can dispute. For example, they might say:
“It only costs 1 million dollars to reduce pollution by 50%”
“Every year, the mining company leaches 500,000 liters of pollution into the river”
“Future generations, when asked, will be willing to pay $100 million for the healthier community and ecosystem they enjoy thanks to the reduction in pollution”

Based on the expected future cost predicted by the local community, Option places a certain amount of negative money into the account of the mining operation.
But what happens if the local community overestimated the size of the future cost? In that case, the mining company can respond with their own predictions, making lower predictions (which they also stake) about the costs of their behavior. For example:
“It costs us 3 million dollars to reduce pollution by 50%”
“Every year, we only leach 100,000 liters of pollution into the river”
“Future generations, when asked, will be willing to pay $10 million for the healthier community and ecosystem they enjoy thanks to the reduction in pollution”

By taking this action, the mining company reduces the amount of negative money Option places in their account. However, this isn't the end of the story. Now all the money that was bet by the mining company and the local community come into play. That money becomes a bounty which can be paid to researchers and journalists for helping to refine the accuracy of the predictions.

Disverifier Selection
How do these journalists and researchers get selected and paid? That's one question this grant will fund.
The funds earned from this grant will go toward exploring the exact mechanism for how to select informed, unbiased, and sincere researchers and journalists (or ""disverifiers"" in Option's parlance). There are three reasons to think this is a tractable problem:
Option offers a natural way to identify bias — a measure of ideological “distance”.
Sincerity and accuracy can be well incented by staking mechanisms.
Iterative deepening of predictions is a mechanism for incenting precise and resolvable predictions.

Furthermore, this work is worth funding even if optimal disverifier selection proves impossible. It may be possible that the worst case performance of Option is still marginally better than some existing governance process. For example, we might imagine that Option fails to live up to the standards of the real-world legal system, but offers efficiencies for use in:
Governance of Decentralized Autonomous Organizations
Open science modeling, e.g. in regenerative agriculture
Governance of content moderation on platforms like YouTube, Facebook, and Twitter or their web3 alternatives
Replacing bespoke web3 incentive models with API calls to Option, e.g. Sybil resistance for Gitcoin, or decentralized Yelp where each reviewer makes the claim, ""This review was left by a real customer who was not paid.""
DAO certification and open source software funding via predictions like, “This project has no vulnerabilities.” Which simultaneously offers information about the confidence of the developers, while providing bounties for red teaming.

Use of Funds
This grant will fund three primary activities performed by the Decision Science and Control (DeSCon) lab of Dr. Philip Brown (or his students, depending on the complexity of universities ∪ crypto ):
Prove game theoretic properties about the model (or simplified versions)
Implement the model in-silico and characterize its behaviors
(Stretch Goal) Implement Option as an interactive game

Questions worth exploring:
What's the Byzantine Fault Tolerance of the inference model?
Can we characterize capacity for information aggregation?
How do wealth effects (e.g. high income inequality) affect system behavior?
How quickly can a poorly funded accurate predictor overcome a well funded inaccurate incumbent?
Can Option be framed as a version of a known game for easier analysis, e.g. Beauty Contests?
What happens if we allow pricing of positive externalities? Does that introduce risks of collusion?
Is Option capture-proof? How well does Option handle the more general problem of Moral Hazard: companies paying to retain policies that are profitable.
In what ways might this be exploited to leak private information (e.g. private values and beliefs or transaction history)? Can modifications avoid that?
Can cognitive biases distort the game theoretic prediction, e.g. paying someone in a dubious claim induces sunk cost bias and doubling down.
What are the expected psychosocial externalities of using Option? Cf. Twitter and Facebook’s tendency to incite outrage. Look at personas like: intrustors, citizens, disverifiers,
Given that Option creates funding as a function of disagreement, does this create a meta incentive for disverifiers to stoke disagreement? How does the magnitude of this incentive compare with the existing disagreement incentive of an elected government?

This is an incredibly high level overview of Option and its purpose. If you would like to learn more about the details of the mechanisms that underpin Option, here are some good places to start:
Claim Market Prototype (link) This is a toy implementation of the Claim Market, the token layer of Option.
Semantic Market Deck (link) This deck overviews the mechanisms of the Semantic Market, the inference layer of Option.

Adoption Plausibility
Finally, it's worth addressing the most common objection to Option: if Option makes it more expensive to purchase goods and less profitable to sell goods, and it opens companies up to an additional form of liability, how will it ever get adopted?

For companies, Option fills the same niche as LEED certifications, Better Business Bureau grades, Corporate Social Responsibility teams, and Fair Trade and Organic product labels. For companies that are sincere in their claims, Option creates a measurable surface upon which to demonstrate that sincerity. A company that practices ethical manufacturing will accept Option's currency and stake predictions on Option in order to differentiate themselves from competitors that only purport to practice ethical manufacturing.

Some consumers will reject transacting in non-Option currencies just as some people today refuse to purchase non-Fair Trade goods. Other consumers will transact in Option simply because it can save them money on certain products, e.g. the health insurance savings thanks to the voluntary tax on soda.

Finally, for regulators and lawmakers Option provides new mechanics for making regulations that are responsive to the research community. In the long run, communities, nations, and planets with better foresight and a better ability to avoid negative externalities will outlast those that don't.",Valid Ethereum Address. https://youtu.be/RARKiBnN3us unable to be reached.

7464,0xDeadList,1,0x6a55eB9b0eD52EfDdE184033F315269b09d4F0e2,"We just won Polygon Buidlit Hackathon Public Good Track Prize!

Inspiration
When we say that an Ethereum account has been lost, it refers to two cases:
The owner forgets the private key, which means the assets are permanently lost.
The owner leaks the private key, which means anyone with the private key can act the same as the original account owner.
Our project aims to protect account owners of the latter case, which is very dangerous: the account owner loses the exclusive right to use the account, which indicates the account is not secure anymore.
For leaked accounts, DApps should be aware of them on time to protect the original owners of these accounts. For example, when one reports that her account is leaked:
Multi-signature wallets (e.g., Gnosis Safe) should ban this account.
Web3 email providers (e.g., MetaMail) in which users log in with signatures should suspend everybody's access to emails of this account to protect the privacy of the original owner.
Electronic agreements based on ETH accounts (e.g., ETHSign) should disqualify this account from signing new agreements. Because the new agreements signed may not be authorized by the original owner.
To solve the above problems, we propose the 0xdeadlist.io project to maintain a list of addresses whose private keys have been leaked. By rewarding the burier NFT (Non-fungible token), 0xDeadList encourages users and hackers to report accounts with leaked private keys, and stores the information of these leaked accounts on the chain to facilitate DApps project parties to query these insecure accounts.
What it does
0xDeadList is a public good that encourages users to collect and report addresses whose private keys are leaked. Users can directly log in to 0xdeadlist.io to report the leaked address. The main contract of 0xDeadList provides two steps (lock address and bury address) to report leaked addresses under the following considerations:
Preventing the reporter's NFT reward from being stolen by front-running attacks.
Ensuring the reporter has enough time before the private key of the leaked address is fully disclosed.
In step 1, the reporter locks the address to be buried, and the contract records the address of the reporter. At this time, the private key of the locked address will not be disclosed.
In step 2, the user uploads the private key of the locked address in step 1, and the reporter address recorded in the contract will receive an NFT reward, indicating that the address is buried, and the buried (or say, leaked) address will receive a tombstone SBT (Soul Bound Token), which is not transferable. In step 2, the private key of the buried address will be made public (recorded on-chain), ensuring the leaked address is indeed leaked.

7427,On-Chain Commercial Licensing for NFTs,0,0xF026Fa6504a05a8ebB8E984Ee01abb0a093E3463,"On-chain commercial licensing scheme for NFTs starting with Meebits 🖼️🔏⛓️
 
MeebitsDAO is partnering with FluidNFT Labs to build on-chain commercial licensing for NFTs and the required royalty payments infrastructure to ensure the visibility and verifiability of commercial licensing within the NFT ecosystem.
 
Problem:
 
Executing commercial licensing agreements off-chain risks potential buyers unknowingly purchasing NFTs with existing licenses that may affect its value and restrict their buyer’s rights. Without automatic terminations, NFT purchasers may also miss out on potential revenue streams and/or lay claim to them which is a legal risk to both the seller and counterparty.
 
Solution:
 
FluidNFT enables NFTs to hold their own assets and liabilities. Building on top of FluidNFT makes it possible for holders to grant perpetual licenses and sub-licenses, and to sell these licensed NFTs together with their revenue streams.

Our core deliverables are:

📄 Commercial licensing legal templates
Legal templates to be made available for Meebits Owners looking to license their Meebits for select known use cases. Templates to be compatible with OpenLaw for writing to the blockchain.

🖼️ MeebitDAO Commercial licensing NFTs
Commercial Licensing NFTs to be minted with each agreement. With the OpenLaw legal contract to be embedded in the NFT´s data. 

🌊 On-chain Royalty Revenue Streams
A royalty revenue distribution protocol and Javascript SDK to fairly and continuously distribute royalties to licensed Meebit holders utilizing Superfluid or Sablier’s implementation of EIP777 for continuous streams. To enable counterparties to pay via fiat on-ramp. 

👾 On-chain commercial licensing SDK

The most popular service among attackers of DeFi projects was the Tornado Cash mixer. However, after it was blocked by The US Department of Treasury, other projects will likely take over this niche. Aztec Protocol, which is a privacy-first zk-rollup on Ethereum, could be a potential such project. 

The Proposal

To improve attack detection in the Forta Protocol ecosystem, it is proposed to develop two separate bots covering both the account funding stage before an attack and the money laundering stage that occurs after the attack is performed.

Funded Account Interaction Bot
This bot detects when an account that was funded by Aztec Connect interacts with a contract.
The severity of these findings is low, as they do not indicate malicious activity. However, in the presence of other suspicious activity, they greatly increase the accuracy of attack detection.

Money Laundering Bot
This bot detects when numerous large transfers are made to Aztec Connect, potentially indicating post-hacking money laundering activity. All user transfers are summed up within a specified time and checked for exceeding the threshold. The severity of such findings is high.

These bots will work similarly to existing bots for Tornado Cash, and I'm sure they will be able to increase the accuracy as well as the number of detected attacks.

I'm a Ukrainian developer, who has been developing bots for Forta Protocol since the beginning of the project.

7318,Help more newcomers to have their first ENS name without hassle,0,0x027FB871101a865E0e3440a78aA073BE85763C5B,"ENS is now widely recognized as having won the race for being the Web3 identity standard. However, compared with unstoppable domain, ENS still have much less registration numbers (Till Aug 2022, unstoppable domain has more than 2.5 million names registered while ENS total registration number is still less than 2 million.) 

We think the key reason behind this situation is that it is actually more difficult for new users to have one ENS name since most of them will encounter difficulties in acquiring Ethereum, paying gas fees and even having a wallet, which are all essentially needed in registering an ENS name.

Buy.ensdom.com is a website to help more new users to register their first ENS name without concerning about the trouble to get ETH and the lengthy time to understand the complex ENS registration process.
Our mission is to help more newcomers to join the ENS community with extreme convenience and best ENS registration experience, thus helping to grow the ENS ecosystem.



Our service helps the users to buy their ENS domains in 24 hours at a fixed price in USD. Once customers try our service, we will help register their chosen ENS names instead and transfer to their wallet in 24 hours. Thus, people will no longer have to worry about the gas fees nor having ETH. What all users have to do is to choose the ENS name they want to register, provide necessary information to us, check out through their own credit card and wait for our confirmation email that we’ve actually sent your name on your wallet within 24 hours.



By using our service, customers can actually purchase their desired .eth names without the hassle of having their own ETH plus other fees. Even people who lack understanding and knowledge about the requirements of purchasing their own ENS name can actually have their own .eth names by using our site.

We really hope our service can provide newcomers with best ENS user experience and meanwhile let more people to discover the charm of ENS and to register one for themselves. In the end, we hope we can jointly help grow the ENS community.

PLB is a UK-based meeting place, bringing together people and organisations in regenerative practice to create the right conditions for systemic change. Land is the basic platform for life; we improve access to land for regular communities.

PLB’S PURPOSE AND VISION

PLB is a Community Interest Company that facilitates equitable, regenerative places and ways of living for the people of the UK.

Land sits at the core of many social, ecological and economic issues. Effective stewardship of land will be central to sustaining biodiversity, sequestering carbon, and maintaining general environmental health. Local access to land will be central to food system literacy, and localised food supply chains – not to mention mental and physical health. Rising land prices are driving housing affordability crises in many places, which amplify existing inequalities, whether racial, gendered or class-based.

This is a snapshot of the context we are working in:
The UK is home to a wealth of community-led housing projects – but often groups feel like they are navigating uncharted waters. Knowledge, resource and tool sharing could and should be streamlined.
Many people want to develop sustainable, affordable ways of living – but struggle to find like-minded people with which to form settlements, co-operatives or community land trusts.
Community-led housing groups, small businesses, among others, often cite access to land as a key barrier. The price of land in the UK has skyrocketed, growing by almost 600% since the mid-90s.
Those who successfully find land, they find themselves struggling with volunteer burnout due to lack of compensation for labour, or the weight of administrative and governance responsibilities.

Land is more and more inaccessible, which is a huge issue as we face housing, biodiversity, and climate crises. PLB addresses this first through creating robust networks through which to learn, collaborate, and build.

Our long term vision is to help realise a diverse network of decentralised regenerative settlements, with providing for their basic needs through land-based practices.

Connecting communities affected by lack of access to land, and building coalitions among those who have shared values and goals, will be key in pursuing these diverse neighbourhoods. This way, we can share diverse skills, experiences, resources and privileges, in order to learn and build together.

When more alliances are formed, we hope to develop easily replicable models for acquiring and stewarding land, with a view to developing regenerative, equitable settlements. We could connect those who want to live low-impact with landowners seeking to use their land in civically-minded ways, for instance. We want to share knowledge so that more people can learn how to navigate the opaque and daunting planning system, develop replicable pathways to acquiring and stewarding land, or experiment in democratic methods of neighbourhood governance (often known for its administrative bloat and bureaucratic burdens, thus essentially limiting participation to those who are time-wealthy).

GRANT

Our next step in this journey is to hire a dedicated community manager. Our online community already consists of people from all over the UK. To nourish a robust, resilient community and make the most of our networks requires more time and energy than we volunteers currently have capacity for; to be sustainable, such labour must be fairly compensated. \\n\\nAs we navigate the uncharted waters between land reform, regenerative placemaking and web3 in the UK, we will need the help of various advisors who are more experienced and knowledgeable in web3 than we are. Most of our volunteers come from the built environment and community-led housing spaces, and we will need technical and strategic support from people familiar with the UK context and the broader web3 landscape.",Valid Ethereum Address.

7429,Web3MQ - Web3 Messaging Protocol,0,0xA126F99e0DEFc3bFa963064314c4b1D54c872DCc,"About
Web3MQ is a Web3 native messaging protocol and communications network. At Web3MQ, we believe that social communications should be a public good. The ability to send messages between, users, addresses, and machines, is so fundamental and important that it should (and in the long run needs to) be driven and owned collectively by developers and users (all mankind). This is why we've built Web3MQ so that anyone can participate by hosting nodes and growing the Web3MQ network just like Ethereum.

Features & Use Cases
DMs: Let users and users connect
Notifications & Web3 mail: Allow projects to notify and send asynchronous messages to users/wallets.
Chat & Community: Build community amongst your users. Web3MQ is one of a handful of Web3 messaging protocols that natively support group chat from day one. 


Characteristics
Interoperable: We reconnect isolated social platforms with a unified inbox, enabling information to be freely generated, flowed and communicated across terminals. All you need is the other person's address or compatible DID.
Scalable Fast (we're serious): Web3MQ is not a toy network with a Web3 concept. We're seriously designing this to serve the next billion users in Web3. We're already faster and more scalable than any other Web3 messaging network and are approaching Web2 performance.
Composable: Web3MQ is built to be maximally composable. We focus on building the best messaging network. Storage, encryption, and public chain compatibility are designed from day one to be maximally composable. Developers can achieve higher levels of privacy protection and satisfy other personalized features/needs through highly customizable configurations.
Natively Multi-Chain: Web3MQ is a middleware infrastructure network, our design is fundamentally compatible with any chain, and with minimal extensions, can send messages between addresses between any two chains.
Ownership: No singular party can tamper with your messages or dictate the way you build on Web3MQ, it's a collective network of nodes. Web3MQ will ultimately be driven, refined and updated by the community,

Background:
Problem
Decarbonizing the economy is critical, but if we’re going to avoid the worst effects of climate change we need to start removing 10 gigatonnes of carbon annually from the atmosphere. 

Last year was a record year–but we only removed about 2% of that goal. And almost 100% of that amount came from businesses & corporations. 

If we’re going to remove atmospheric carbon at the scale we need to impact climate change, we need to mobilize consumer funding. 

But how? Historically, consumers won’t pay to fund carbon removal.  


Our Solution
Hazel, our web3 platform, empowers consumers to take direct steps to remove carbon and fight climate change. By rewarding consumers with fun, valuable NFT rewards that they can use in Hazel, we’re making it fun to help reverse climate change.  

With Hazel, users will be able to:
🌱 Fund carbon removal & unlock rewards that enhance their Hazel experience
🌱 See & learn about the projects they’re funding and visualize their positive climate impact 
🌱 Earn NFT rewards for using Hazel, which automatically generate carbon-removal funding when sold
🌱 Have fun while making an impact on the planet!



A fun & empowering gaming experience

There is a lot of climate doom out there right now. We need hope & empowerment. We know people do what they think is fun--and we need fun when considering a global problem such as climate change.

7321,ENS Spoofing Bot: Detect a Scam Name That Looks Like Yours,0,0x7b736FE138775D1fCD2CFE4E1D6158BfF3a2F28e,"ENS Spoofing Bot detects attacks in which someone registers a name visually similar to an existing one. 

Forta Protocol, which monitors blockchain events in real-time, together with this bot allows attacks to be detected before they happen or to minimize the damage from them. What's more, every ENS user will be able to receive an alert if it happened to their name. 

The problem

Names in the Ethereum Name Service are unique, but there are no restrictions on registering look-alike names that are visually very difficult to distinguish from genuine ones. For example, having a name vitalik.eth, an attacker can register a similar name by replacing the symbol lowercase L with uppercase i: vitaIik.eth. The name is visually similar, but it is treated by the protocol as a completely different name, with its own hash, as well as an address bound to it. 

This type of attack is called a homograph attack. Regarding the ENS protocol, it can be performed in the following ways:

Substitution of character pairs i/I, i/j, O/0, w/vv, m/rn, which depending on the typeface, may be difficult or impossible to distinguish;
Replacing ascii characters with visually similar ones from Unicode; for example, “faсebooсk.eth” uses the letters o and с from Cyrillic;
Use of invisible Unicode characters; 
Spoofing using uppercase letters; for example, bitcoin.eth may be spoofed as Bitcoin.eth. 

ENS fights this attack pretty hard by normalizing names before they are registered, as well as warning against using non-ascii characters on its site. However, to save gas, such checks have been implemented off-chain, on the frontend side. Any user can register a name bypassing the official site by calling the protocol contract directly.

The Proposal

It is proposed to develop a Forta bot that monitors on-chain contract events responsible for registering "".eth"" names. As soon as the bot detects a new registered name, it tries to normalize it and checks if a similar name has already been registered. If so, the bot fires an alert specifying the registered name, the existing normalized name, and the addresses of the accounts to which these names are bound.

Forta Protocol allows each user to subscribe to alerts involving their addresses, so if their name is spoofed, they will immediately receive a notification in one of the convenient ways: Email, Telegram, Discord, Slack or Webhook.

In addition, when combined with bots that detect subsequent stages of suspicious activity, we will have enough evidence to claim a scam attack. For example, the next follow-up checks could be obtaining tokens, selling them, and laundering funds through services like Tornado Cash. 

As a result, the Forta ENS Spoofing Bot will play an important role in detecting scam attacks, maximizing the chances of their detection.

About the Author

I'm a Ukrainian developer, who has been developing bots for Forta Protocol since the beginning of the project. You may have seen me as a frequent contest winner as well as an active member of the community. At the moment I developed 16 bots, some of them are in the Forta Threat Detection Kit.

7430,SproutUp: Turn Good Deeds into NFT Impact Certificates,0,0x763debb2dDFe4655fdA0871Aae8FDFb386C36b23,"About

SproutUp is the web3 charity startup platform. SproutUp let’s anyone turn good deed videos into NFT impact certificates and earn crypto donations. 

Why

There are two key bottlenecks to solving climate and social issues:

Entrepreneurship
Accountability

Nonprofit laws create red tape, fees, and financial incentives for founders. And traditional donations do not hold organizations accountable for impact. Donors have little idea how their money is used.

As a result, our nonprofit sector is captured by decades old, legacy organizations that don’t innovate. These nonprofits have been failing to solve climate change and other issues for the past 50 years. We need to empower the next generation web3 organizations.

How

SproutUp solves these issues with impact certificates. SproutUp users turn their project outcomes into NFT impact certificates. For example, a tree planter can turn videos of their planting projects into impact certificates. Each donor gets one unique tree impact certificate for their donation. Donors know exactly where their money goes and get to own proof of their unique tree project forever. 

Impact certificates align incentives for more impact. Currently, most nonprofits use the same fundraising business models regardless of their work. SproutUp will create many different types of impact certificates, enabling web3 charities to tailor their business models to their work. This lets web3 charities align their own needs with those they serve, their donors, and broader society. A win-win-win-win. 

Impact certificates promote entrepreneurship. A key barrier for nonprofit startups is trust. Donors prefer large brand-name organizations when making donations, as nonprofits offer little transparency. Impact certificates give donors perfect transparency, enabling founders to more easily fundraise. The sub-saharan tree planter can now out compete the global NGO. 

The transparency of impact certificates also makes nonprofit status irrelevant. Founders can start a SproutUp web3 charity and create impact certificates in minutes without any nonprofit fees or red tape.

Our goal is to support climate social impact founders. Our impact certificates live on the carbon-negative Polygon blockchain and use IPFS for decentralized metadata storage. Gas fees are less than a penny, eliminating any financial burden for founders and donors. 

Funding

This is a one-person bootstrapped team! Your funding supports my continued work on SproutUp. Every little bit helps. Without funding, I may soon have to put SproutUp on hold.

Team

I’m Nate, the founder, developer, and sole team member at SproutUp. I’ve been working in sustainability and the social sector since my first environmental nonprofit internship 10 years ago. I previously built a “common app for nonprofit grants”.

With our platform these companies eliminate the risk of double selling supply, improve their sales processes, easily scale multiple channels and ensure compliance with governments plus registries. 

Carbon removal companies have historically lacked tooling to help the industry scale; many organizations use nothing more than excel spreadsheets to track their operations. Our startup is building tools for these companies to better manage their operations, and making it seamless for them to keep track of their inventory using distributed ledgers or push that inventory to the growing demand channels in the ReFi space.

About Mangrove
Started by two former founders in the climate-tech space, Mangrove is creating the operating system for carbon removal companies. 

Inventory Management
Right now most organizations removing carbon are keeping track of what they can sell using spreadsheets; this creates the opportunity to mix sales up and potentially double-sell inventory. 

With Mangrove these companies can manage their inventory in one place, place holds on tons of carbon that are proposed to buyers, and automate the issuance of inventory.

CrunchDAO is a Decentralized Autonomous Organization of scientists making use of collective intelligence to solve complex problems, powered by a solid tokeconomics.

Many other women face the same bias in current AI models ranging from failed facial recognition to loan applications. Why are AI models struggling in recognizing gender, people of color and other communities? 

The majority of Web2 AI development is currently developed by a homogenous group of people and either controlled by large tech companies or Western Ivy league universities. With a lack of diversity comes a lack of empathy and imagination for the needs of society at large. AI companies heavily overrely on datasets of data-rich countries and this skewed data training has led to the discrimination for the rest of world.

stories_of_ai is applying for funding to drive DEI engagement for their DAO framework for decentralized AI teams and their communities.

Proposal

stories_of_ai’s research highlights that there is surprising a lack of DEI collaboration in AI and Web3, the majority of Algovera’s squads are white, male and/or from data-rich countries. We would like to change this.

We like to build bridges so that AI teams can easily form interdisciplinary teams and connect with communities and data. We envision the co-development of AI models and that communities will receive returns for their data. Communities need the ability to co-design, get transparency, contribute data, retrain AI models, and get remunerated.

stories_of_ai is a squad in the Algovera ecosystem. Algovera is a community of independent AI teams developing user-centric Web3 AI applications.

Deliverables 
Grant funding will accelerate research and co-design on the 2nd pillar of our Decentralized AI DAO framework called “Community Value Generators: How to achieve sustainable DEI, environmental and commercial value creation.”

Our deliverables are:
“Creating bridges”. 
Active outreach and open call for DEI communities. List of technical/non-technical/data-poor/intergenerational community leads for DAID workshops. 
“Stories of people” 
Content creation and qualitative interviews for podcast/youtube videos. 
Research and co-design session: Topics such as DEI code of ethics in web3/decentralized AI/
How can communities complement data to reduce bias in algorithms and get remunerated through marketplaces? How can algorithms be regularly retrained?
Bounties for DEI consultants to join in workshops.
Working group and codesigned code of ethics for development of decentralized AI DAO.


About stories_of_ai
stories_of_ai, a squad of Algovera, has developed a human-centered decentralized AI framework (DAID). The DAID framework enables how AI teams and their community can keep ownership of, and monetize their AI model creations. DAID also provides tools and strategies in how to build a decentralized AI DAO that is based on a vision of human cooperation, augmentation, sustainability and DEI.

About Algovera
Algovera is a community of independent AI teams developing user-centric Web3 AI applications. stories_of_ai has received one Algovera grant to date for work developing a Decentralized AI DAO framework (DAID). Algovera Grants has funded 28 independent AI teams (called Squads) to date. Algovera also trains squads to use decentralized AI infrastructure, which consists of decentralized storage, compute and marketplace.

Motivation
Centralized AI systems do not actively consider community ownership or how to integrate gender, racial or sustainability factors in developing AI models. Researchers have highlighted the harm of AI models that are benchmarked in human-competition, autonomy and centralization [How AI Fails Us: Divya Siddarth, Glen Weyl et al. 2021]. They propose a human-centered vision of developing AI models that complement, cooperate and support society rather than compete with humans. 

We like to propose pluralistic strategies of how to develop decentralized AI organizations. We believe that bringing together diverse communities within web3 and squads would be mutually beneficial to the community.

This is why stories_of_ai has developed a Decentralized AI DAO framework (DAID) which accelerates AI teams with technical tools and strategies that are rooted in interdisciplinary team work, human-centered design, ethics, sustainability and community commercial models.
DAID consists of 4 key areas:

    1    Primary - Design Thinking: who is the user and who is impacted by my AI model?  
    2    Community Value Generators: How to achieve sustainable DEI, environmental and commercial value creation.  
    3    Decentralized AI activities: from data sourcing, storage, training, deploy to publishing AI models to market places.  
    4    DAO activities: covers how to set up a DAO, governance, proposals, treasury management and member protection and monetization of data sets and AI models  

Work Package 1
Our aim is accelerating interdisciplinary teams to push towards the development of AI Web3 projects and DAOs. Our goal is to bring together communities such as everyday people and Black in AI, women in web3/AI, LGBTQIA+ with GnosisDAO, Data Science for All, Ocean Protocol, IPFS and Algovera.

Grant funding will provide research and co-design on the 2nd pillar of our DAI framework “Community Value Generators: How to achieve sustainable DEI, environmental and commercial value creation.”

Our deliverables are:
“Creating bridges”. 
Active outreach and open call for DEI communities. List of technical/non-technical/data-poor/intergenerational community leads for DAID workshops.

We give them 1 full hour of educational session about ENS basics and how to handle and maintain the domain, then we register their desired domain for them, fill out the records and deliver it safely to their wallet with zero hassle from their side.

ENS Buyer's Brokerage
With the exponential growth of ENS adoption, especially in the past 12 months, many individuals and businesses cannot find their desired domains as they're already taken. With this Brokerage Service we help them by reaching out to the current owner of the domain in various ways, see if they're willing to sell it, we handle all the negotiations and only when we get to an agreement we take a small commission of the final sale. Then we fill out the records and deliver the domain safely to their wallet with zero hassle from their side.
With this service, we also give them 1 full hour of educational session about ENS basics and how to handle and maintain their domain.

ENS Hourly Consultation Sessions
Many people want to learn more about ENS project and technicalities behind it, so we offer hourly consultation sessions about the following topics:
Introduction to ENS

7423,Future Folklore,0,0xef22454779df275E59fE42d5A4b49b43f19778C8,"Future Folklore is building a funding platform for materials science and technology efforts surrounding Unidentified Aerial Phenomena (UAP). With growing interest from the United States Congress, NASA, key researchers at Stanford and Harvard, and others, there is a tremendous opportunity to work on one of the great mysteries of our time. This is where the DeSci movement is crucial: the UAP subject is of global importance, calling for open and broad-based collaboration and ownership in the research.

Future Folklore has three broad focus areas:

Materials science: Funding labs to conduct analysis on recovered UAP materials.
Engineering & inventing: Funding technology innovations to better conduct UAP materials science, and novel technology which integrates insights from materials science.
Ecosystem development: Developing this nascent ecosystem through networking and incentivizing new and existing contributors, such as academic metallurgy labs.

Future Folklore will use this grant money to support DAO structuring, and set-up, operating, and other related expenses.

FF is looking to grow its team and form working groups, covering task areas like sourcing and distributing materials for study, or networking metallurgy labs. If you’re interested in web3 and the UAP subject, please reach out!

Background: UAP, materials, and science 

Are UFOs real?


Source: Instituto Geográfico Nacional de Costa Rica

Branches and high-ranking members of the US Government have repeatedly and recently said UFOs are real and are to be taken seriously. Their preferred term is unidentified aerial phenomena (UAP), now expanded even further to “unidentified aerospace-undersea phenomena.” 


Source: Department of Defense via AP

This new name, though cumbersome, is a nod to the ""transmedium"" performance characteristics of some of these anomalous vehicles. In other words, some seem able to pass through space, air, and water domains. In one well-known case, Navy operators report tracking “objects [that] appeared suddenly at 80,000 feet, and then hurtled toward the sea, eventually stopping at 20,00 feet and hovering. Then they either dropped out of radar range or shot straight back up.” 

Eventually some pilots were told to rendezvous with an object, which they discovered was hovering above the water, “around 40 feet long and oval in shape” and moving erratically. After engaging with the object, which responded by moving up, “It accelerated like nothing I’ve ever seen,” one pilot said. Within a minute it was mysteriously tracked at their next rendezvous point 60 miles away, but was gone when the pilots arrived. Congressional hearings on UAP this summer, the first in over 50 years, confirmed that this case is still unresolved.

In June 2021, the Office of the Director of National Intelligence published a report on UAP, saying some UAP “appear to demonstrate advanced technology,” and that “Some UAP appear to remain stationary in winds aloft, move against the wind, maneuver abruptly, or move at considerable speed, without discernable means of propulsion.” 

Congress has mandated their new UFO office, now named the All-domain Anomaly Resolution Office (AARO), to study the technology and intentions of UFOs. They have also requested that the new office not study objects deemed man-made. New legislation already in effect also requires of the new office ""the testing of materials ... to better understand and explain unidentified aerial phenomena.""

Are there such materials? In private hands yes, some, and of these, some with solid and independent witness testimonies and chains of custody for the materials.


Source: ""Improved instrumental techniques""

Dr. Garry Nolan, professor at Stanford, inventor, entrepreneur and holder of 40 US patents, has been studying recovered UAP materials. As lead author, he recently published this peer-reviewed methods paper with a case study: ""Improved instrumental techniques, including isotopic analysis, applicable to the characterization of unusual materials with potential relevance to aerospace forensics"" in the journal Progress in Aerospace Sciences.

Speaking with VICE, he has also said some material in his custody have unusual isotopic ratios: ""...if you find a metal where the isotope ratios are changed far beyond what is normally found in nature, then that material has likely been engineered—the material is downstream of a process that caused them to be altered. Someone did it. The questions are who… and why?""

Another recent study with a lingering ""why"" was published in the Journal of Scientific Exploration, analyzing the 1957 Brazilian Ubatuba UAP fragment. They found ""One definite strangeness"" with the sample—a strontium impurity. ""The strontium impurity is not a normal by-product in the manufacture of magnesium and would have been intentionally added."" Here's a brief video surveying the study of UAP materials.

Many wonder if the US Government has more material, and more that’s intact and operational—even entire craft. It’s difficult to determine. The New York Times has reported that classified briefings have been given to Congress concerning “off-world vehicles not made on this earth.”

NASA recently began engaging in formal UAP research, saying they're taking it very seriously: “We're going full force … This is really important to us, and we're placing a high priority on it.""

Dr. Avi Loeb is a professor Harvard and was the university's longest serving chair of the Astronomy Department. He recently founded The Galileo Project, whose mission is the systematic, scientific search for evidence of extraterrestrial technological artifacts. This notably includes attempts to capture images of UAP. They'e installing ground-based telescopes for this, including on the roof of the Harvard College Observatory. The Galileo Project already has post-doctoral fellowships.

Future Folklore's conviction

Much more could be said, and more studies and contributors mentioned. Future Folklore stands on the conviction that if there's the slightest chance materials associated with UAP have an exotic origin, then funding and analysis is paramount. It may not surprise readers that funding channels are thin or nonexistent. The philosophical and technological possibilities, though possibly slim, are too great to ignore.

Future Folklore also stands on the conviction that organizational models enabled with web3 technology are appropriate for the study of UAP, which requires an all-hands approach. We need broad-based collaboration and ownership models. For those new to decentralized science models, here is a recent profile published in Nature Biotechnology covering some leading DAOs.

Run Haus' digital community and IRL real estate infrastructure is organized to support outdoor running as a vehicle for a global revolution in personal and global consciousness, health, and sustainability. We know that a thriving world and happy societies are on the other side of a good run.
Our public good mandates are providing group runs, events, community spaces, and housing that make it simple for members to get running daily in order to realize their fullest physical potential while connecting with a likeminded community and the planet.
A coworking space for people who’d rather not be working
Remote work is redefining the modern meaning of success. Free from the stresses and time burden of office life, remote work is affording many professionals the space to recreate and build their lives around interests besides their professions. A recent 4,000 person study found 28.76% of current runners started running during the pandemic, and for many, running has become an indispensable part of their lives, providing daily access to health, nature, and in-person community in an era when many are going the opposite direction.

Run Haus' multipurpose community hubs are designed around the special needs and habits of this recreated, remote-worker-runner-human. Run Haus provides a centralized community, work, and cultural space to meet for a run, catch up on work, recover, socialize, share talents, eat, drink, laugh, and build a healthy, well-run world together.
A home for people who people who are outside most of the time

Run Haus is also building a distributed housing network designed around the needs of high performance humans and the tribal, interdependent ways human naturally organize their lives--doing this within America's problematic housing regulation and economics.
Run Haus homes most closely resembles ""co-housing,"" which usually involves a shared single-family home or combination of homes that share resources, time, and each other's company. Run Haus homes puts people with shared values, habits, and lifestyles in one location, presenting myriad psychological, logistic, and economic benefits. Those shared values center on ""peak personal and planetary health,"" an ambition to make oneself, one's community, and the world as good as it can be, not merely as good as a broken status quo permits. More specifically, the Run Haus community is bound by commitments to:
Carrying one's own weight, literally and figuratively.
 Continual improvement of one's body and mind through daily, strenuous physical activity, with a deep focus on running, specifically.
 Direct, in-person communication and interpersonal interaction. A deep respect and reverence for the natural world expressed in frequently connecting and spending time in nature away from modern stressors like social media, work, traffic, etc.
 Protecting the environment and live materially minimalist lifestyle.
 Continual intellectual, emotional, and spiritual growth.
 Promoting economic, cultural, and generational diversity, equity, and interaction.
 Creative, not conventional, living. ""That's not normal"" is not a meaningful criticism for one's behavior, and should be considered a compliment.
The Run Haus DAO
The Run Haus coin is the community’s primary currency and is earned through demonstrated value to the community; i.e. adding demonstrable services, goods, and efforts to the network and community and its related projects, external community services, etc. A sample use case for a coin exchange might involve a capital rich/time scarce member trading coins with another member with more time than money, e.g. a semi-elite racer without a sponsorship.
Membership privileges:
Access to like-minded, health and sustainability oriented community
 Access to spaces and events
 Access to in-network membership services and products: Coaching Physio and fitness classes/instruction
 Professional services (writing, photography, video, accounting, etc.)
 Food and beverages
 Internal product marketplace

FacHub is a platform that enables users to create new NFTs that can include non-lockable content or generate gated links for token holders.Non-lockable content is media that requires proven ownership of an NFT or social token in order to gain access. The platform also allows users to sell and buy NFTs using ETH.

Creators are always seeking ways to give their fans more value and differentiate their work from their competition. FabHub empowers creators to secure their content so that it’s only accessible to holders of certain NFTs or tokens. Usually, creating tokens that allow access to gated content requires technical knowledge. FacHub allows non-technical users to do so.

Their white labeled NFT product means that anyone can create an NFT store, regardless of their technical expertise. This approach allows users to avoid fees from platforms like OpenSea, giving more flexibility around user experience and more control over their brand.

FacHub’s white label NFT storefront product can be used by non-technical people, broadening the potential userbase of web3 technology. ‘Lazy minting’ means zero gas fees for creating NFTs, which is a welcome relief in today’s high gas environment.

Blockchain technology and ENS is here to take the stress out of buying and selling tickets, and MetaTicket.eth is the answer.

MetaTicket.eth is an exciting company dedicated to bringing the ticket buying experience back into the hands of genuine fans by creating a fair and transparent ticket buying, selling, and renting platform using ENS and blockchain technology.

MetaTicket.eth will provide an entire marketplace for event tickets where users can buy, sell, trade, and rent their tickets all in one secure place. Each ticket sold will use ENS subdomains to create an NFT, meaning your ticket automatically becomes a collectible that can grow in value and eventually be sold or held. And because it's secured on the blockchain, you will know you are holding a real ticket that will get you into the event.

With this decentralized platform, fans will control how they buy and sell tickets to their favorite events. 

MetaTicket.eth will start focusing on Metaverse events once the ENS Name Wrapper is released. Gradually, as the team grows, we will expand to other online and in-person events. MetaTickets can be utilized for conferences, sporting events, music events, and more.

7446,Reunited DAO - Alliviate Pain Worldwide,0,0x171DA557cfe7eAb89aE42b282Bae8E21EA02b0ca,"Have you ever lost a loved one?

If you have, it was probably one of the biggest pains in your life.

But imagine not knowing what happened, imagine that loved one left home one day and never came back... worldwide this is a reality for millions worldwide.

Missing people shatters lives, families and communities.

Reunited is an awarded project at ETH Mexico developed as a decentralized (peer-to-peer) easy-to-use solution to help people find their missing loved ones.

After ETH Mexico we have decided to bring this project to life as a DAO and partner with stakeholders in the space to help people everywhere in the world find missing people. But we can't do it without donors to help cover the costs of infrastructure and support those working to help find missing people.

The problem.

Missing people is the result of wars, conflicts, human rights abuses, natural/human-made disasters, organized crime, trafficking, drug violence, migration, among other factors.

The International Commission of Missing People acknowledges the huge challenge that represents having reliable databases; information is scattered, unreliable, outdated and in many cases even censured.

When a person goes missing there is a huge psychological, physical and economic damage for all parties involved; the missing, the families and the communities.

This is a matter of peace, truth, justice, reparations, mental health, security, economy, migration, equality and other topics. It can be also viewed from a discriminatory perspective on gender, origins, race, sexual preference and social class.

Thousands of people go missing every day.

It's not overstated that missing people shatter lives, families and communities.

The solution.

We have developed a functioning prototype platform that allows people to report missing people in a simple way. Information is stored on the blockchain making it transparent, uncensorable and easily accessible. Yet information will be encrypted to avoid bad actors. Finally, we have a system that allows those who might have found a missing person to frame them with a camera device to compare it with the database using an Artificial Intelligence system to try to find a match.

Key Benefits:

+ Inclusive. Available worldwide and easy to use (you only need an email, password, data and photo of the missing person.

+ Decentralized. A P2P database to help scale efforts to match unidentified people with missing people. Furthermore, making it permissionless may help this grow more than any current system.

+ Immutable. This database can be tempered by any government or third party.

Use cases.

+ Vulnerable communities: Help kids, migrants, disabled, victims of traffic and other vulnerable people get back home and reunited with their loved ones.

+ Unidentified diseased. Help families get certainty closure and reunite with the remaining of their loved ones.

+ Missing pets. Potentially we could customize the software to help find other species, like cats & dogs.

Use of funds.

We are live since 2019, and currently have 7 partner communities in Brazil, Costa Rica and Ethiopia, with a total of around 8,500 members using Cambiatus today.



We allow community members to exchange goods and services in our shop, using their social currency to connect members skills and profiles with each other while saving their fiat currency for other interactions. This way the community gains collective strength to face the challenges presented to us all in the present day. 
 
Cambiatus has been open source since day 1, and we believe our communities contribute a lot to the Regenerative Finance movement that is happening in web3. We were awarded the Shapers Awards in 2021 Blockchain 4 Humanity Prize and were also finalists at the Top Tier Impact Awards in 2021. We are collaborating with the ReFi Spring movement and always looking for ways to collaborate with planetary regeneration efforts. 
 
Our partner communities became more financially resilient and less dependent on fiat money because they are using their own social currencies. They can reward members for actions that are related to their collective objectives and create an internal economic cycle.Those actions promote the community objectives, acting as an engaging tool that fosters the collaboration of people from different perspectives and experiences.


 

Examples of those actions are: participating on beach cleanups, as a volunteer in an agroforestry task force, contributing to a given forest conservation area, and many others, that depend on the community context and objectives.

We would like to use this grant to keep onboarding new partner communities, develop more educational resources, and keep building new tools to our platform. One of our priorities will be creating content about web3, ReFi and social currencies in Portuguese and Spanish, to enable more people from Latin America to join our movement.
 
We would like to show real life examples of how we can use web3 tools to empower communities and enable a transition to a low carbon economy, focused on financial resilience, connection with nature, wellbeing and the pura vida spirit!
 
Cambiatus has an open source business model, and works on a voluntary contribution basis from a variety of cultures and backgrounds, as you can see in our plans. We also have ample experience doing deliveries, being a group of practical and hands on attitude. 
 
We work with decentralized technologies combined with centralized ones, making one effective transition tool that has its head aiming for the future, but with our feet on the ground, using the best tools for the challenges that may arise. 
 
Our goal is to raise USD 50,000 and maintain our team for 4 months.
 
✅ Some deliverables we would like to achieve:
Create content in Portuguese and Spanish about the importance of web3 and social currencies in the current economic context.
Showcase real life examples from Cambiatus partner communities in a way to incentivize other community leaders to take action and start their own social currency.
Launch Impact NFTs with all our partner communities.
Review Cambiatus tokenomics looking for a resilient model.
 
📍 Our Tech roadmap:
Create governance tools that allow an Exit to Community process.
Evolve the current marketplace to enable hybrid payments (FIAT + social currencies).
Develop the Roles and Permissions feature, to prevent fake accounts and other issues.

Tornado Cash Smart Contracts Sanctioning Efforts
 
Treasury's sanctioning of  smart contracts—software programs—is the most significant policy action in crypto's history. While sanctions are intended to incentivize change in non-US persons' behavior, immutable smart contracts cannot be altered. Thus, the practical effect of the designations was to prohibit U.S. persons from using TC smart contracts. But, as we've all learned over the last few weeks, the downstream consequences already have grown significantly beyond that and may yet continue to.
 
What we've done so far:
The day after the designations, we submitted a Freedom of Information Act (FOIA) request to the US Treasury to help shed light on the sanctions action.
Since the arrest of TC developer Alexey Pertsev in the Netherlands, we've been trying to found out whether it's related to the sanctions designation and gotten some very troubling new information and responses from the Dutch government in response (charges and relation to sanctions still unknown). 
Worked to keep the community updated with what we know.
Shared our perspective with Congressional offices on the situation and the inappropriateness of using sanctions authorities to ban US citizens from engaging in certain activities.
Made the case in traditional media outlets, including the WSJ, NYT, Time, Cybersecurity DIVE, Decrypt 1, Decrypt 2, Coindesk, and The Information. 
 
Our plan going forward:
 
Mitigate: We’re petitioning Treasury to issue “general licenses” that would allow US persons to engage in activities otherwise prohibited by the designation of the Tornado Cash smart contracts. Often when Treasury designates an entity, it’ll concurrently issue a “general license” to allow for US persons to “wind down” their activities and relationships with newly designated persons, entities, and (in this instance) so-called entities. For example, when Treasury designates a foreign financial institution, it can issue a general license for US persons to withdraw their assets and cease interacting with that financial institution for a period of time. A general license in this case could allow lawful US persons to, among other activities, withdraw their assets from TC smart contracts without breaching sanctions obligations. We (and many others) are also urging Treasury to issue guidance and FAQs with respect to the many outstanding and critical questions that are previewed above.
 
Advocate: We need to convince Treasury (and other governments) that sanctioning, restricting, or targeting the use of open-source software (and potentially those who write and publish open-source software) isn’t the best way to accomplish their policy objectives and isn’t in the US national interest on net. While the legal basis of the sanctions in this instance relies on considering non-persons/non-entities (software programs) as persons/entities, the government has a vast array of related and unrelated authorities that it could tap to effectuate a substantively similar outcome. The only thing certain is that we don't want to find out. The damage already caused by this situation has been consequential, and it’s not in anyone’s interest for something akin to this action to happen again.
 
Litigate?: Our friends at Coin Center have laid out why they believe the designation of a non-person/non-entity may be beyond the authority OFAC based its action on and may be unconstitutional.

The open source hardware and software solutions that we develop are meant to empower independent researchers , teams of scientists, analysts, lab technicians to license and sub-license their IP without the need for centralized intermediaries, supporting the growth of #desci and decentralized journalism. Our commitment to balance between decentralization , and individual sovereignty is reflected in our development with both #dStorage solutions like IPFS and Arweave, as well as with user first architectures powered by Dat://
We are bridging the gap between the real world and the blockchain. We work to bring transparency, accountability and accessibility to environmental and social governance and opening the flood gates on data silos in environmental and social governance while creating accessible, repeatable, and equitable solutions for verifying real world observations that prove sustainable and regenerative action.
Who We Serve
The best way to illustrate how our work creates value for the entire Web3 and Refi Ecosystem in a diverse number of ways is to talk about our partnerships. We partner with Impact NFTs, game developers, certified offset marketplaces, NGOs, activists and land stewards to facilitate the secure, equitable and verifiable flows of data from the real world to decentralized ledgers. We have a major role to play with growing number of projects and organizations of which the following are just a few examples.
Celo : Developing Solutions for the verification of natural capital and ecosystem services.
dMeter : Infrastructure Working Group Lead driving collaboration, interoperability, and decentralization in environmental monitoring reporting and verification.
OPADES: Deploy IOT mesh network and edge computation deployment for early wildfire detection, parametric insurance, and ReFi MRV.
Ogallala Life, BasinDao, etc: Deploy IOT mesh network and edge computation deployment for water quality and aquifer recharge, biodiversity, and wetland habitat extension.
Open Forest Protocol: Develop tools, models, and smart contracts to facilitate consensus driven validation of OFP assets.
Pozzle Planet: Design, develop and implement positive sustainable action validation protocols.
Ocean Protocol: Develop tools for verifiable claims / credentials and algorithmic consensus contracts. Increase accountability and transparency in web3 data markets.
FOAM: Develop solutions for IOT interaction with EVM compatible smart contracts. Field test proof of location zones with Lora.
Helios: Bringing increased credibility to reporting in solar infrastructure.
We Need Funding For
Developing & Implementing v1 ImpactNFTs, a verifiable on-chain resource for validating Impact.
Our verifiable data sources will be minted into IP preserving smart contract using ocean protocol. DataToken are then used to facilitate access to the underlying data and generate revenue for the data providers, curators, and validators. These DataToken also facilitate the governance over the process and procedures that keep the data credible.
Our Impact Certificates are tied directly to the data required sign verifiable claims about real world observations relating to the projects and initiatives they are intended to support. This mechanism will both facilitate small projects and even individuals to verify claims relating to impact while removing the excuse of proprietary data that big polluters use to hide from transparency.

7343,ENS Arabic Twitter Sales Bot,0,0x6a08ed0C51A3114D6a5347f1D0D33b1932dC93A7,"What we are doing
We created a Twitter Sales Bot that only tweets about the sales that have Arabic Unicode characters (Letters and Digits).
This Twitter account has already attracted over 1100 followers since we launched it in June 2022 (2 months ago).

It is currently monitoring Arabic ENS sales that are happening on 3 marketplaces:
OpenSea
LooksRare
ENSVision

Why create Arabic Sales Bot?
There are over 400 million Arabic speakers in 13 different countries around the world. I believe this Sales Bot will play an important role in drawing attention to the ENS project from the Middle East and Arabs in general around the world.
This will eventually help the adoption and onboard new contributors to the ecosystem.

How this funding Helps
We will keep on updating this bot whenever any of these marketplaces change their smart contracts, and we're also planning to add more marketplaces to it. 
This funding will help compensate us for our time we put in creating, editing and monitoring this Sales Bot and the Twitter account as well.

7389,LanguageDAO: Lowering Language Barriers in Web3,0,0xc360c72b24e97Bc5f65745CD8430B34FfFe174f1,"The goal of LanguageDAO is to lower language barriers in web3 through a combination of translation and interpreter services and mission-driven activities. The services include interpreting conference calls like DAO Twitter Spaces and translating crypto white papers, which often feature evolving technical jargon and regional slang that defy automated translation solutions. Revenue generated from these types of services fund mission-driven activities consisting of outreach into the marginalised countries, free education, and advocating for web3 organisations to increase language accessibility.

Historically, English has been the ubiquitous language of web3 (Bell, 2018), although that fact is changing. Although English-speaking countries make up the majority of job locations on the web3.career (Web3 Career, 2022) website, just over half of the top 50 countries are non-English speaking. This is one indication the web3 industry is flourishing across the world. Subsequently, web3 teams will increasingly need to communicate with other teams who speak a different language.

Similarly, crypto markets are booming throughout the global landscape, hungry for products and services. Nigeria, Vietnam, the Philippines, and Turkey rank the highest in terms of crypto adoption rates (Buchholz, 2021). Additionally, 60% of consumers say they will not buy a product (CSA Research, 2020) if they cannot read the marketing language. The market in China for Bitcoin rapidly expanded once Satoshi’s whitepaper was translated into Chinese (Bell, 2018). Understanding a crypto market, and the underlying technology, is fundamental to participating in that market.

Web3 presents an opportunity, allowing unbanked individuals living in countries with limited banking systems access to financial services. Additionally, web3 can enable entrepreneurs to sell goods abroad, when these individuals would otherwise struggle to connect with international payment systems (Scott, 2016). Yet, persisting language barriers threaten to cut off marginalised countries from the opportunity of web3 (Bell, 2018). To further complicate the problem, terms for blockchain infrastructure, DAO governance, etc, can specialise within different geographical and cultural silos. Eventually the industry may settle on open standards, but in the meantime lingual and cultural translation has the potential to play key roles in facilitating both commerce and coordination (INATBA, 2020).

7370,The Explorer's Tribune,0,0x6679F8B83F8354b930f2486958bcB0FB9aDd547B,"A monthly periodical from the world of Loot Explorers that commissions and publishes quality fiction for an in-universe newspaper.
 
Overview
We are the Shapers' Society, a group of writers working as Loot Explorer characters within the Lootverse. We want to follow the example of The Genesis Scrolls and publish great lore for the Explorers era of Loot.
 
The Explorer’s Tribune already exists as a short newsletter that is sent out to holders of Loot Explorers. We want to redevelop and expand the Tribune in time for the launch of the Hideouts expansion for Loot: Explorers. The new Tribune will accept stories written by characters in-universe that could be (in-universe) fact or fiction. This would function as a way to keep collectors up-to-date with world events and updates, become an engine for driving Explorers lore, and encourage others to develop narratives within this ecosystem. 
 
We propose to accomplish this by putting out a call for writers to contribute stories to the Tribune. Each month, our editors will select three stories to be published in the next edition. To facilitate the professional and creative development of our submitters, our editors will provide written feedback to the top 8 submissions.
 
With the grant we will be able to hire these editors to read and revise submissions from authors. There need only be two editors for each issue, and they can rotate their duties. Authors will be paid a flat fee for stories that are published.
 
The aim of the Shapers Society is to bring more attention, respectability and imagination to the Lootverse. We also want to grasp the golden opportunities arising with the dawn of Web3 publishing. The Eye for Adventurers and the Librarium are pioneering that model, and we believe that the Explorers world provides an ideal playground for brilliant minds.
 
 
The Explorer's Tribune
We believe that now is perfect time to restart The Explorer's Tribune because The Loot Explorers team would like to feature editions of Tribune within their new Hideouts, as well as on their website. The Tribune will give added value to holders of Loot Explorers through exciting new fiction, it will reward creative people who are already enthusiastic about the world of Loot and will onboard new people, enriching the ecosystem with their ideas and experiences.
 
We will endeavour to make sure that, after publication, the stories featured in the Explorer's Tribune are shared with other relevant projects within the Lootverse, such as by contributing them to The Eye for Adventurers (as a society, we hold The Genesis Eye already).
 
 
The Budget
A projected pipeline for each issue, with associated costs.
 
Editorial: The editors will read all entries and select suitable ones. The selected entries will undergo some rounds of copyedits, redrafts and tightening between the editors and the author. Rejected entries will be given meaningful feedback.
 
Each issue will have two editors and they will receive $150 each.
 
Editors for the first three issues (the scope of this grant) will be members of The Shapers' Society.
 
Writers: Successful submissions will earn their writer $200. We will include three stories per issue, so that amounts to $600.
 
Writers will be solicited from all corners of the Lootverse and beyond. Style guides and canon advice will be given by The Shapers' Society.
 
Social Media Baron: Each issue will be publicised through official channels. We will release a truncated version of the tribune for social media in addition to the full version to holders. Furthermore, the selected entries will be pushed to other relevant projects within the Lootverse. All of these small tasks are apart from the standard editorial, so a separate role is required.
 
The social media baron for each issue will be paid $50.
 
Redesign: We would like an artist to redesign the Explorer's Tribune, building on the original template, so it aligns well with the tone of The Shapers' Society. They will need to create designs for the truncated and full versions of the tribune, as well as for the style guide. For this work, we will allocate $200.
 
This gives us an operating budget of $950 an issue, with a one-off starting fee of $200. Our proposal here is to raise enough for three issues of the new Explorer’s Tribune as a pilot scheme. The total we need for all three issues is $3050.
 

The Shapers' Society
As mentioned earlier in this application, The Shapers' Society consists of a group of writers working as Loot Explorer characters. In other words, all of our work will be completed in character; this would include all editing and feedbacking of article submissions, as well as running of social media channels. By embodying the ""Lore not Floor"" ethos in this manner, the Shaper's Society will contribute characterisations to both Loot Explorers and the wider Lootverse. Our society is open for people to join and is hosted as a guild in the Loot Explorer's Discord server. To give a flavour of our ethos, here is the Shapers' pledge:
 
As members of The Shapers' Society, we burden a great responsibility. We map the past by developing the stories and legends we judge to be valuable and, by doing so, we erase the rest of history. It is our work that will be remembered; our work provides a shared culture for future explorers to build and expound upon. Hence, it is vital that we all take the following pledge:
 
+ As a shaper, I will collaborate, rather than compete, with my fellows.
 
+ As a shaper, I welcome criticism and when delivering my own criticism, I will ensure that it is constructive and actionable.
 
+ As a shaper, I understand that CC0 applies to work shared within this society, meaning that shared work is available for anyone to adapt or use as they like.
 
 
Many thanks for your time reading this proposal. Regardless of the success of this grant, we hope the Lootverse keeps flourishing. 
 
Signed,
The Shapers' Society

7369,Pluriverse.wtf,0,0xC3E5ae984FC22DCD6716ce88DeA2934C14e22Ffc,"We are making a guide to the pluriverse! It is an interface between fanciful and purposeful labors. It keeps two worlds in balance: the integral vision of regenerative cryptoeconomics espoused by Gitcoin and the integral lore visualized by a whole community of sci-fi-fantasy-MMORPG-crypto-governerds.

Our work is inspired by the Cellarius Universe Guide commissioned by ConsenSys. We interpret this project as an invitation: to dream wildly together, to meld the dystopian vision with our utopian ambitions, to meld the hopeful with the realistic, and take accountability for how our current focus on automated money might secure an intentional and optimistic future. Although Cellarius has fallen to the wayside, we wish to elaborate a fresh solarpunk vision with enough fidelity to allow a new audience of regen creatives to actualize these principles through their contributions.

The key to our pluriverse is to render the imagery at a sufficient resolution to make it feel immersive and purposeful, yet alien enough to avoid perpetuating our rivalrous desires. We’re not talking about virtual cubicles or augmented meeting spaces, but a repository of that will probe the peripheries of the imagination. We are also just as interested in investigating how our virtual, augmented, and LARPing fantasies manifest in our meatspace habits and behaviors. The pluriverse is the UI between these experiential dimensions, and the Pluriverse Guide, DAO, and community are the incubators for our experiments.

This is an excellent opportunity for the Ethereum community to elaborate on how our blockchain technologies can support fledging and speculative community development. We are dedicated to asking difficult social problems, meditating upon the tragedy of the commons, and securing support for public goods. We need to support each other to collectively peer beyond the apocalyptic veil, cross the threshold, and leverage our cryptoeconomic theories to manifest positive change in the world. We might take this opportunity to resist profiting off of our shared resources, to restrain ourselves from racing to the bottom, to rethink our motivations to preserve our abundance. Creatives have been used and abused so much that it has become a tragic-comic archetype, a living cliche of the disadvantaged visionary, the artist starving for cultural approval as well as a stable living wage. We need artists to continue asking the difficult questions, to crack us out of our collective neurotic, paranoiac, schizo-capitalist delusions, and dedicate themselves to imagining ways of moving beyond pure economic incentivization. We need artists to diminish the civilization’s obsession with heroic identities and illustrate a clear (and realistic) tomorrow without enslaving humans to the protocols of distribution in the process. This is a sincere call to very deliberately and intentionally meme ourselves differently to each other.

What is our lore? 

Storytelling is the technology of imagination. The stories that we tell ourselves create the constraints of our worldview and our ability to actively world new worlds. If we are constantly reinforcing an imagination architecture that presents us as subordinate or enslaved to powers beyond our control, then abracadabra! So it shall be! That is the reality that we will occupy.

We must learn to manifest differently, and so we must learn to articulate differently, and so we must support each other to imagine differently. Who is the storyteller? What community do they represent? How is that community illustrated to itself and to others? How does the community orient itself to divergent perspectives?

Our fantasies, myths, and markets suffer from scarcity. They provoke us to grind, to hoard, to incessantly level up. They are competitive and rivalrous, privileging customizability over standards that allow us to align and collaborate more effectively. How might we learn to change the canonical lore of our own imagination, to shift the narrative of the stories that we tell ourselves? We hope the Pluriverse Guide and the Gitcoin Comic series might support optimizing for human values, not perpetuating paperclip machines all the way down. We hope to play our part in this ontological game by strategizing to wield our memes with tact, subtlety, and profound nuance, to break the illusion of phantasmagoric shadow play that Moloch - which is to say - has cast upon our speculative future for far too long. We hope to nurture this community’s propensity to imagine differently and confront the Moloch meme inside all of us. We must not sacrifice our future potential to the memetic chimera!

Cheers to a bright future! To a solarpunk future!

However, DAOs are, in their emergence, still not the soft landing for tired hearts and minds.
 
Things were easier when we had more straightforward definitions of an organization and a few ways to relate too: employer and employed, LP and partner, organization and associates. When one thinks very limitedly, the solution space is easy. When DAOs came in, we said that we are all and more. You are a contributor, a member, a mercenary, a worker, a researcher, vibes officer, a client, a shareholder, a steward, a supporter and an enthusiast. We aspired to value everything. All the streams of value creation that were dismissed were niche and uncounted. Healthy to go beyond to forge new ways, yet we confuse ourselves by not having a language or map. 

And a reward that is expected and not met is a punishment.
 
As an ecosystem, we do not yet provide a clear and sure way to communicate and set expectations on what individuals might take back when they create value. The risk is that if we do not correct the course on DAO compensation and rewards practices, we will end up with “the great disappointment” - A more disruptive event.\\n\\nWe are set to undertake a research project and provide the ecosystem with a deeper understanding of the topic, a shared language mapping the territory, a clear framing of the existing challenges for contributors and DAO leaders alike, and a mental model to define compensation and reward mechanisms.
 
We aim to deliver this research as a public good on composable “compensation and rewards” primitives, taking a holistic approach that includes practices across ancient, traditional and Web3.
 
The deliverable
 
The insights from our research will be delivered as a guidebook, which will help DAO people and web3 organisations to;
Aid their thinking and decision-making in selecting rewards and compensation mechanisms for their DAO.
Communicate and set expectations on rewards and compensation with DAO members
Move the needle by inspiring new building blocks, tools, and articles building on this public good research.
 
The guidebook will consist of three parts.
 
PART 1: A map of primitives classified mainly on Value Creation Accounting (measuring the value of contributions) and Rewards and Compensation (distributing or attributing said value)
PART 2: Considerations when choosing the primitive(s) to use
PART 3: Case studies from the ecosystem (including learnings from using different systems).
 
To help visualise, the primitives can be bounties, salaries, access to services, and reputation, whereas considerations can be viability for the DAO, sustainability, safety of the individual and aspiring to build a particular culture. As the research advances, we're expecting a growing list of primitives and consideration angles, and it will be our work to disentangle all the options and requirements into a usable, clear framework.
 
To gather the primitives, we will look at diverse organisations, geographies, cultures, and eras to compile the composable list.
 
How /Execution
 
We have a core team and contributors to carry out:
Desk research on human needs and motivational factors.
Compensation and reward practices across history and in Web3.
Conceptual developments in academia for compensation and rewards systems, frameworks, and language.

The issue with private knowledge graphs

Mining knowledge graphs using computation (e.g. querying, causal reasoning, machine learning) is gaining value in the development of therapeutics. Because of this value, high-quality knowledge graphs are often kept private.

Siloed knowledge graphs prevent individuals and organizations (e.g. academia) from developing insights that could lead to life-saving therapeutics. It also creates inefficiency in industry as work is duplicated and insights are not shared.

A graph open to the commons

This project will create a decentralized analytical grade knowledge graph open to the commons, where contributors to the graph are rewarded when the graph generates value for patients (e.g. IP generation)

Core activity and use of Grant

Create an analytical grade longevity knowledge graph with Discourse Graphs as edges detailing the relationship between the nodes. The grant will be used to fund researchers analyzing the scientific literature with a small percentage going to administrative costs to cover things such as computation.

Example Nodes
Biological features, e.g. protein names
Therapeutic interventions, e.g. rapamycin
Phenotypes, e.g. >110% life expectancy increase in WT drosophile melanogaster

Why Discourse Graphs?

Turns scientific information into knowledge claims (as opposed to concepts) and provides evidence and context that supports/opposes that claim. Discourse graphs promote more efficient use and comprehension of data for both humans and computers.
Discourse Graph Data schema (Claims/Questions/Evidence/etc.) will enable interoperability and allow researchers to use different tooling from our workflow if desired.
The discourse graph data schema was developed by Joel Chan with support from Protocol Labs to augment and accelerate individual and collective synthesis.

Tooling

Graph notebooks: tool for collaboration on scientific research compatible with discourse graphs and a new format for publishing (ex: Roam Research, Logseq, DECK)
Lateral App: tool for literature scan, review, analysis, and synthesis into a Discourse Graph. Early access web3 native collaborative interface for navigating, coordinating and contributing to decentralized discourse graphs.

These terabyte-scale datasets would benefit from sharding, in IPLD Content Addressable aRchive (CAR) files for example, to overcome limitations related to inodes and 32 GB file size caps in IPFS/FileCoin infrastructure.

Our goal is to also share applications of the open source code to improve awareness. Awareness in the scientific computing community of how Web3 improves verifiability, scalability, and sustainability of scientific datasets. And awareness the Web3 community to understand how to provide usable, impactful tools for decentralized science (DeSci).",Valid Ethereum Address.

Willer is used as a testamentary notary: entrust your ERC20, NFT or ERC1155 tokens to Willer smart contract, make the will setting up beneficiaries’ addresses, shares and release time, then try not to lose your private key=)
The testator must extend release time to prove his access to private key. When the release time is expired, beneficiaries will be able to activate release function to perform the bequest of the tokens.

Sounds pretty simple, right? Always to have plan B. But I see long way to robust and well tested tool.

The models will then be used to transparently analyse carbon offset projects around the world and assess nature’s contribution for ReFi.

🌱 Decentralised Science (DeSci) for Nature

“We can’t value what we can’t measure. And we are failing to capture nature’s contributions.”

Monitoring the natural world is critical to enable local communities to access climate finance. Unfortunately, current machine learning models are closed-source, proprietary and developed without the involvement of local communities.
LabDAO and GainForest are working together to mentor and support contributors to the repository from everywhere in the world. Our previous research brought together cover satellite, drone, mobile phone image analytics, and DNA sequencing.

🎓 Stipends, Publications and Impact Certificates

The funding from this gitcoin round will be used for contributor stipends of about 1-3k USD. Applications for the lab will be reviewed by community members within LabDAO and GainForest. We will encourage applicants from traditionally underrepresented communities to apply.
LabDAO and GainForest team members will guide all stipend recipients during their research journey. Recipients will receive impact certificates as POAP. Additionally, developed machine learning models have a chance to contribute to GainForest’s $10M XPRIZE Rainforest participation.
Applications for contributors joining the lab will be simple, open and inclusive. (1) a short call and (2) a link to some previous work is all we require. We believe everyone can become a scientist.

🌴 Real-world Projects, Real-world Impact

We are collecting large-scale data from nature conservation and reforestation partners around the world to create the world's most transparent projects, datasets, models and science. Recipients have the chance to work closely with many of these projects, join data collection efforts (if feasible) and learn from local communities.


🛰️ Why Regenerative Finance (ReFi) is DeSci’s New Frontier

Half of the world’s corporations have committed to net zero by 2050 and they all of them will require carbon offsets to achieve their goals. Unfortunately the market for nature-based offsets is a wild west where we lack transparency, integrity and community support. Our mission is to fight greenwashing, disrupt the market with open data, models and science to provide accountability and empower high-quality carbon and biodiversity projects. 

All research contributions will be hosted on GainForest’s open transparency dashboard and is accessible for everyone within and outside of the ReFi movement: beta.gainforest.app

A decentralized society needs decentralized media, and the Web3 world needs such media: services for the public good with sufficient positive externalities, transparent operation, independent views, and respect for diversity.

Using a DAO to build media has many benefits: decentralization ensures its neutrality and open source spirit, and deeper interactivity ensures its credibility and pluralistic values: everyone can join the governance, initiate the selection, and participate in the production of content.

Pirate Radio will build a series of podcasts to achieve a complete sense of decentralized media to talk about Web3 in a Web3 way.

Pirate Radio has attracted media professionals from frontline radio and podcasts, DAO researchers, and Web3 developers. The sailors aboard Pirate Radio will once again set sail on an epic voyage, like their radio predecessors, who sailed the high seas of England in the 1960s playing rock and roll. Like the pirates who searched for the promised land and treasure during the 16th-century geographic discoveries, riding the waves and sailing the crypto seas through the paradigm shift!

Building the next phase of the Circular Economy with Web3. 





Circular Economy >> Blue Circular Economy >> Blue Heart Economy

The Blue Heart Economy is the evolution of the Circular Economy when applied to the regeneration of the ocean through Web3.



The ocean is the soul of humanity: it is mysterious, unknown, vast, beautiful, pure, and so many shades of blue. It is also fragile and like so many ecosystems, suffering and on the verge of collapse. For far too long, we have treated the ocean as humanity's dumping ground, out of sight and out of mind. We will soon have more plastic than fish in the ocean, plastic is everywhere and seeping into our water, food, and air. It is critical that we act and innovate to stop this senseless tragedy.

We can use web3 to incentivize the behaviors we want to see.
Web3 allows us to express and share our passions.

We are artists, creators, entrepreneurs.


We come from the divine
We create from divine inspiration

Entrepreneurship is a creation process, it is the ability to see new worlds and create them. 
Web3 empowers creators.  

And enables social impact entrepreneurs to fully express what's in our hearts, and build the world we want to see.


The Art (our creative expression) is at the Heart of Web3



Connection to Soul and Heart

Tulum is a magnetic and beautiful destination, it has been a place of immense sacred importance for the Mayan culture for thousands of years, it is a place of flow and pull, where the world’s largest underground system of freshwater rivers flow. 



Created out of the great meteor that hit the earth and wiped out the dinosaurs, abundant waters now flow throughout Quintana Roo and its more than 6,000 cenotes that were formed from the impact millions of years ago. 

Each cenote is a powerful energic source, some with rock formations hundreds of thousands of years in the making, underground jewel boxes, big open lagoons, and many more diverse bodies of water that have magical healing and cleansing powers.



Also Tulum



How can we clean Tulum and be an inspiration to the world?

Creation of a new circular economy, the Blue Heart Economy enabled by web3 with a mission to de-plastify the planet through the merging of digital and IRL worlds and incentivizing new behaviors.

Chama : Kenyan women self help and self governance informal groups

This project aims to develop pilots to onboard Chama to Web3 to enable them to 
- Scale using digital technology
- Develop additional revenue streams including ecosystem credit generation and sales

Potential Pilots: 
Mangrove Reforestation/EcoCredits
Women’s ReFi savings group - Women from farming communities

———————-
Details

Grant Total being raised: USD 50000 

Purpose: 
To support ReFi initiatives amongst women and indigenous communities in East Africa in partnership with Regen Network. 

Cultural Context: Community Savings Groups

Chamas or VSLAs began to spring up in the late 1980s as a response to a lack of affordable and accessible credit. These self governing groups have evolved to include various loaning mechanisms and staking and rewards systems. It is estimated that over 300,000 registered chamas exist today in Kenya, with members collaborating in more than one1 chama in their lifetime. 

Although there is a push towards digital options for bookkeeping that increase transparency and improve governance such as Aturi and Ecobba, many of these groups remain informal, relying solely on the bridge of trust that brought them together in the first place. This informal sector worth over $4bn in Kenya has increased grassroots development and involvement. Communities take charge of their own investments and tailor their financial system to fit their culture i.e. the funeral fund, which is traditionally how Kenyans fundraise for funerals. 

This project aims to develop pilots to onboard Chamas to Web3 to enable them to 
- Scale using digital technology
- Develop additional revenue streams including ecosystem credit generation and sales

Potential Pilots: 
Mangrove Reforestation/EcoCredits
Women’s ReFi savings group - Women from farming communities

The project is being developed with a one -year timeline with the below requirements

Staff:
- Developers
- Implementation, Training & Support:

Period of time for implementation & results:
1 Year.

Milestones:
- Setting up the DAOs (2 Daos, one in Kenya and potentially one in India, Indonesia or Myanmar) We’re creating a DAO incubator, including tech tools, community support, feasibility studies. 
- Feasibility report for other regions
- Prototype of a community staking pool for impact investment


KPIs:
--People reached 
- Impact on community, documented through multimedia/human interest stories
- Outreach and discovery
- DAO Design Toolkit


Socioeconomic Benefits of Success
The foundation creates a case study for the global financial sector - proving DeFi can be used for impact investment products in emerging markets. 
The potential market size of East Africa alone is massive with 11 million community owned savings groups already in existence.

What’s The Problem Here:

	With more and more students obtaining credentials instead of capabilities, employers are being forced to spend increasing amounts of money on their selection & hiring process. Having caught on to the credential inflation taking place, hiring managers are piling on job requirements in an attempt to differentiate candidate’s qualifications. 

	Although this large-scale problem stems from universities’ incentives to enroll and graduate ever-increasing amounts of students, it is amplified by recruiting vendors building tools based in this systemic credentialing problem.

	The opportunity is for individuals to develop the knowledge, skills, and abilities needed to thrive in the 21st century while providing employers a viable solution to address the growing skills gap and compounding need for upskilling the workforce.


Creating the Base-Layer Infrastructure upon which a few affordances are built in:

Composability of artifacts that are added to the network, embracing open innovation and adaptation.

Those who share-knowledge retain ownership of their content, being rewarded over time according to its learning impact.
Teachers should get paid based on their impact on human capital development.
Learning actions & outcomes are recorded on-chain, creating a network of learning paths.
Allowing for individual exploration to be accounted for.
Employers/DAOs are able to support human capital development.
Through backing those who share-knowledge and/or providing opportunities for learners to apply their knowledge.

This grant is part of a Warrior Love Productions initiative to use funding to capture and amplify stories of regeneration, as well as a grassroots movement known as ReFI—Regenerative Finance—being led by technologists to direct blockchain innovation toward environmental justice and social good. The grant funds will go toward the production of “Banking on Nature,” a documentary series and educational curriculum spotlighting Regeneration leaders and ReFi innovators working collectively to heal and enrich the Earth.
 
Summary: 
This eight-episode docuseries takes an investigative and entertaining approach to exploring different parts of the world where blockchain technology is being harnessed to support climate action. The show will spotlight climate innovators and activists rethinking how society creates and allocates value and how those models intersect with ReFi. We will explore carbon markets from the Congo Basin to the Amazon rainforest, and peer into the lives of farmers across the Midwest and the Great Green Wall of Africa. Each episode will feature leaders of the natural world and communities building new economies to address one of the biggest threats modern humans have ever faced—and how together we can be the solution. 

Complementing the docuseries will be educational curriculum, masterclasses and workshops facilitated using the Web3 streaming and distribution platform BEEM.xyz.


Episode themes will include: 
- The Psychology of Money and who’s Leading the Charge in Creating Value for the Earth 

- The Rise of Generation R: The Re-Generation Fighting for J.E.D.I [Justice, Equality, Diversity, Inclusion]

- From High Tech, to Low Tech to No Tech: Regenerating Local Economies

- Learning from Lo-TEK: Local Traditional Ecological Knowledge

- Stabilizing Our Climate & Restoring Our Ecosystems

- Diving Into Our Oceans: Our Greatest Carbon Sinks

- Space & Earth: Learning from the Overview Effect 

Notable leaders and organizations to be featured:
Carol Sanford - Founder, Regenerative Business Development Community 
Queen Diambi of the Congo
Julia Watson - author or Lo-TEK
Rebecca, founder of Fibershed 
White Buffalo Land Trust
Zero Food Print
Nemonte Nenquimo — Indigenous leader of Waorani Nation
Tshering Tobgay—former Prime Minister of Bhutan

Regen Network
Toucan Protocol
Climate Collective 
ReFi DAO
Menthol Protocol 
Hedera - HBAR Foundation

Open Forest Protocol
Filecoin Foundation/Filecoin Green 

In total, we’re aiming to raise $2.5 million for production, post production, marketing, and distribution. We’re working with one of the top two talent agencies in the world to secure a distribution deal with a leading streamer, such as Netflix, Amazon Prime, or Discovery+. 

Production Timeline: 
Filming Dates 
November 6, 2022 - United Nations Climate Change Conference - COP27
December, 2022 - one on one interviews with ReFi entrepreneurs 
January 2023 -  Exploring the Congo Basin with Queen Diambo of the Congo

May 2023 - international ReFi Spring events - gatherings of emerging ReFi communities developing solutions. (These may take place at a different time.)
June 2023 - Reshoots
July/August 2023 - Reshoots & post-production - editing 
September 2023 - final post-production 


How will this support climate action? 

We're addressing the disconnect between human stories and the ReFi movement to Green Pill the world. Amidst all the talk about getting carbon credits to the communities most at risk, there’s a significant gap in the storytelling about these communities who are an unequivocally integral part of the stakeholder solution. We'll make sure their stories are told. Our plan is to make ReFi compelling and relatable to investors, Web3 creators outside of the ReFi ecosystem, and consumers who are ready for a climate narrative that promotes hope and positivity instead of crisis. 


Credits and Perks for Funders 
All participating funders will get credit as supporters of the docuseries. Anyone who contributes more than 100 dai will get producing credits and the opportunity to visit filming locations, as well as a chance to get one-on-one training from regeneration experts featured in the series.

7411,The DeSci Academy - Accelerating scientific discovery,0,0x17e4285BeE986aE686504131D3D5ABE0009f297A,"TL;DR
We find and train passionate, driven and curious individuals who want to contribute to science but lack the credentials.
We are NOT an educational content platform, rather we are an open source protocol that utilises peer-to-peer, self organised learning that is facilitated by verified knowledge experts.
This will be key infrastructure to support the growth of Decentralised Science, Impact DAOs and Regenerative Finance
Through decentralised credentials - VCs (Verifiable credentials),  DIDs (Decentralised identifiers) and SBTs (Soul Bound Tokens),  students can build a proof of their learning, thus legitimising their knowledge and building an on-chain, composable  reputation/knowledge score.
We are currently in talks with a number of different DeSci projects to collaboratively develop modules; students would eventually filter into these DAOs and contribute in a technical role.

What is our vision?
Our vision is educating non-technical users to create the next generation of scientists to accelerate scientific discovery.
We believe that education should be free, permissionless and structured in a way that the student has involvement in shaping their own academic journey.

What problem are we trying to solve?
With the rise of Decentralised Science, Impact DAOs and Regenerative Finance, mechanisms allowing effective coordination and incentivisation have emerged allowing for the possibility to collectively solve humanity's biggest problems.
This leads to an issue: There are many people who want to help solve some of the world's biggest problems but lack the technical skills, the knowledge and most importantly the legitimacy (i.e credentials) to do so.
Examples of these groups of people range from those who want to help fight climate change, biohacker communities, patients suffering diseases which have no cure or passionate hobbyists who have a particular interest (eg psychedelics).
Our aim is equipping passionate, driven and curious individuals with the necessary tools and credentials so they can accelerate scientific discovery.
93% of the population do not have a college degree, meaning there is ample room for ancillary and alternative paths. 
MOOCs (Massive Open Online Courses such as Khan Academy) are a step in the right direction but are a centralised, passive form of learning where proof of learning is difficult to verify.

How does our platform solve this problem?

Web3 and decentralisation can unlock new models of education; our product is an open source protocol where students can self-organise their learning from a variety of sources that they choose (i.e. anything from a physical textbook, online resources, podcasts, etc.) and validate that knowledge via peers in a setting facilitated by a “mentor” who has some traditional form of legitimacy. 
In essence, this is a P2P based digital apprenticeship model of learning.
The core of this will be decentralised credentials utilising VCs (Verifiable credentials),  DIDs (Decentralised identifiers) and SBTs (Soul Bound Tokens).
Several key steps are needed to build this infrastructure, including onramps where mentors can put their degree on chain, reputation systems, P2P attestation systems and future scope for novel funding mechanisms (e.g. uncollateralized loans/grants based on a student’s progress or decentralised reputation).

What would the grant go towards:

Our first aim is to develop a Minimum Viable Product:
Architecture: For the reputation-based scoring system, we would use the Ceramic Networks IDX and 3ID Keychain to power Cross-chain identity & reputation. In order to avoid the issues associated with reputation systems (e.g. sybil resistance, reputation calculation, sovereign-identities etc) experimentation and testing will be required until the final architecture is settled.
Pilot Cohort and First Module: The initial module would focus on “Decentralised Science”. It would equip students with in-depth knowledge on crypto primitives such as the blockchain, decentralisation and DAOs as well as a deep dive into the scientific method, data analysis and interpretation and appraising scientific publications. Through this we experiment and fine tune the P2P based self organised form of learning.

An open-source collection of documentaries and guides about people who want to shift to off-the-grid living
 
Our objective is to raise awareness about the non-speculative uses of new technologies, one of those begin blockchain and its whole ecosystem.


Tear down the idea.
 
The movie will be divided into episodes, in which we will go to interview and film all those realities where people live off the grid in an eco-sustainable way aiming at energy self-sufficiency, food self-sufficiency, permaculture, from recycling and reuse to self-production of necessities products. 
 
We will also address the issue of the use of web marketing for a product or workshop, which in many of these realities is the basis for having anyway a form of livelihood for the community.
 
Working in close contact with the main association which in Italy unites all ecovillages forming an association of 30+ realities in continuous expansion. we have participated in several events from this very association where we had more inputs to define and shape our project.
 
 
For the greater (public) good(s).
 
During the trip, we want to write various guides, along with the video documentary, for people and other communities on their path to shift to sustainable off-the-grid life. The biggest achievement for us would be to bring even more people to a sustainable way of life in realities that are already there.
 
We want to give an open-source collection of documentaries and guides about people who want to shift to off-the-grid living, without leaving behind the comfort of modern life.
 
 
Target audience.
 
 
The target audience for our project is quite broad and includes both ordinary people interested in seeing how to live off the grid while keeping the comfort of an ordinary life, people, interested in the use of technology in a solar punk future ideology
 
But not only ordinary people or just curious about alternative lifestyles, in fact, our project also targets big green energy investors and all those big movements on climate change who wants to know and discover the products off the grid people needs and use the most.

Community.
 
Begin the project still at its pilot stage we are starting the community from scratch, friendly roaming around discord servers and Twitter, searching for citizens of the internet who are on the same vision of a sustainable future lived in deep respect of mother Nature.


About us.
 
We are S.(Writer) and G.(Videomaker)  since we met our path has been nothing but a search for what made us happy, and what the idea of well-being was for us.
 
The rat race was never fun for us, we tried to escape the machine, and now we feel the time is right for a change in history. The solarpunk movement is initiating a change we have been waiting a long time for! We are convinced that living off the grid is the solution to climate change, capitalism, and you name it! 
 
On our blog page, you can find a detailed background for each one of us!
 
In the past, we lived several years in these off-the-grid realities in Italy.
Our dream would be to be able to sustain ourselves for one year documenting those realities and then scale this project starting in Italy and reaching the whole world.

 
Funding Objectives.
 
 
-Camper Van
 
Funding would help us and will go towards the purchase of a camper van, finding a sponsor for the camper van would cut our expenses by over 60%
 
-One year of financial freedom.

7409,tProof,0,0x68C85B3eA70C7cAa14Ad0fc52d3A7d03a63Ef64D,"Generate legal evidence that a file exists at a given date, with NFTs as proofs (decentralized proof of timestamp). 



Legal evidence that a document exists at a given date is important in different areas, like:
Courts and lawsuits: if challenged to prove a certification was made before a certain date, you can either rely on central entities, or on a decentralized solution like tProof
IP Protection: while filing a patent, or to record that a document was owned by you, you can generate a tProof and store it with you
dApp UI deployments: every time a new dApp UI build is completed, a tProof of the build files can be made. If a DNS hijacking happens, with a simple browser plugin we could perform a check and avoid users being scammed
other areas where a certification is required

Certification is obtained by publishing the hash of a given file on chain. When the block containing the hash is minted, the timestamp of the block identifies the date at which the certification has been approved. For what concern the hash, we have adopted the standard SHA-256 hash, so that the risk of collision is negligible.

To simplify the management of generated proofs, each one is treated as a standard ERC-721 token (NFT). In this way the proof is tradable, movable and easily viewable. 

Finally, while the file can be stored privately, it can also be made public (on a permaweb, currently supported Arweave). In this way the public URL of the file is included into the NFT proof metadata. Due to the decentralized approach, to make sure the file at given URL matches the hash, a Chainlink Oracle is used.

Main advantages of our solution can be sum up in 4 points:
Decentralized: anyone can interact with our smart contract to generate a tProof
NFT based: this makes the management of proofs easier and more practical, while integrating in multiple existing tools
Multi-chain: the protocol is studied to support multiple chain, while keeping unique IDs among the different chains. Initially Ethereum and Polygon will be supported
File management: files can be kept private or public, based on the needs

We are planning to launch our tool on both Ethereum mainnet and Polygon, but other chains will follow.

Inspired by minimalist 3D design, optical illusions, and palaces and temples from around the world, every monument is a unique, hand-crafted world to explore. Users can create NFTs using voxel-based Monuments/Architecture.
Twist and drag to reshape the world and help the user to explore. Designed to be easy for everyone to pick up, enjoy, and complete.

Mystery Physics Puzzle
It also has physics-based puzzles similar to Room where the player with a series of strange puzzle boxes that feature several physical mechanisms. The player is challenged to figure out how to open each one – typically by undoing a series of locks – to access another puzzle box within it. The game uses a variety of motions enabled by mobile device touchscreens to simulate actions in real life, such as looking around the device, turning keys, and activating switches.

Future RoadMap
Adding More Levels:-  There are only two levels of Gameplay available to Play. We need at least 20-25 levels of Gameplay to make it engaging for players to play. We also need soundtracks to be included in the Game. The following genre of Games are needed to be included in the Game:-
 Optical Illusion
 Physics-Based Puzzle (Finding Clue, sliding Puzzle, Combination Puzzle, Match3, jigsaw
 Board game (Hitman Go)
 Shooting game
 Fighter game\n-Action game
 NFT Card battle game
 City Builder (construct building, gather resources defense kingdom)
 Tower defense
 Turn-Based game
 RPG adventure and many more genres of Games.
Building Better Open World:-This game needs a bigger Open world that can be explored during Gameplay. Interactive elements can be placed inside the Open world which makes them more immersive.
 Better Integration of NFT:- Players have an Open World that they can explore. Puzzles are placed inside the Open-World which when solved, move Players to the next level of Metaverse(New World to explore). When players Solved the Puzzle, they mint an NFT with HitPoints, AttackDamage, and ShieldPoints. These NFTs can be Upgraded, bred, and battle with each other inside the Game.
Players can also purchase Virtual land and in-game Assets as NFTs and Use them as assets to build any genre of Game.
Real-Time Card Battle System:- Inside the Game NFTs can be minted, upgraded, and bred. Players can play the Card battle with each other. The winner can earn NFTs and Points, which can be used to upgrade or bred(Combining two NFTs to mint a new Powerful NFT).
NFT and NFT Game MarketPlace:-NFT and NFT Game Marketplace:- We need a Marketplace where Creators can buy, sell and trade NFTs, NFTs Games, Virtual Land, Open-world, and in-game Assets. Users can rate and review the NFTs, which will improve purchasing decision process and Sales.

Build Voxel Game Maker
This is the most difficult part of this Game Platform. Creators can use Assets and available scripts to build the Game. It will need 1.5-2 months to finish the Game-Maker..
Templates of Open World and Puzzles will be available to customize according to the Player's needs. They can also import Voxel Assets from any voxel editor or the web and then use them to make the Open World of their Choice. They can sell them as NFT on Marketplace and monetize them.
To build different types of Games, Scripts will be needed. For Players with no technical knowledge, there will be several Templates of different genres of Games with scripts, that will be available for modification and combination. With these templates available inside the Game Maker, Players can Change the variable parameters of the script or Add multiple instances of the same template/script to make complex Games.
Users can combine different Templates/scripts to make Innovative Games inside the Metaverse and monetize them in the Marketplace.
Visual Editor (similar to Unity Bolt) for a game where the User uses visual scripting like Powerful flow control graphs (similar to Unreal Blueprints) for low-level logic and complex tasks. Elegant finite state machines (FSM) for high-level logic and easy state management. Create and modify entire graphs while in Play mode.
The Game-Maker will be a downloadable native application (Mac, Windows, Linux). A web application can be created for building Mini Games but to make Big Game Native application needs to be downloaded. So we will have a Web version of Game Maker for Mini Game and a Desktop Application for Big Game. Players can Rate and Review these Games according to their Liking.


NFT GAME Marketplace
The Rating and Review system needs to be added. It will take 10-15 days to finish it
1- The NFT Game Marketplace is an NFT marketplace where you can search and buy creator's ASSETS with Token to incorporate them into your Game.
2- The creator can build games with different assets and templates and monetize them by listing them in the Marketplace.
3- The creator can list both the Assets and Games in the NFT Marketplace and Monetize them according to their Ratings.
4- The Game in the NFT Marketplace can be organized according to their Ratings and Reviews.",Valid Ethereum Address. 
7392,Hepta Protocol: Support donation and incentivize learning,0,0xdFe5dcC946aCD395935c28e0e00122cbFA8eBea6,"Hepta Education makes web3 donation easy, interactive, and rewarding.
Hepta Education aims to build a sustainable learning environment for underprivileged kids. We believe that in order to thrive, the kids need to have three things to start with: an identity, a wallet, and a mind prepared to learn. We designed a whole mechanism around this mission and aim to make it scaleable with the proven business model.

Problem: The entire donation ecosystem is outdated and doesn’t work.
Funds donated through foundations are neither traceable nor outcome-attributable, causing children to lose support.

Solution: A protocol that helps people donate interactively and strengthen the positive cycle. 
The three main features include:
Enhance transparency and traceability with blockchain technology.
Empower individuals to possess identity and accumulate assets.
Build a donate-to-earn and learn-to-earn mechanism.

Tech Design: How Hepta Protocol works
Depending on the identity, every player has different rights and responsibilities as well as ways of interacting with one another.

Progress: Founded in August 2022, we aim to validate all of our hypotheses in Season one (August 2022 - December 2022) and develop a more friendly interface and environment in Season two (January 2023 - April 2023).
A season is a defined period of time with a clear goal and theme.

In Season one, we test out our hypotheses with three validation projects, each with its own goals and metrics. We partner with shelters, foundations, and other web3 tech providers to make sure we “measure” (validation) before actually spending tons and tons of resources of “cut” (building product). Our goals for Season 1 are to:
Sufficiently test out the hypotheses by running the mechanism without protocol.
Get real feedback from real users with our minimum, minimum viable product.
Build a community committed to the long-term success of the project.

The three validation projects include:
India Banjara Community Donation Project
Kaohsiung Teenage Mom Education Project
The EDGE Learn-to-Earn Bootcamp (click in and see more detail about the project!)

7406,A Giant Lab for better solutions against antibiotic resistance,0,0x415784D7d8593959F37D883715eC3e9012eAFAa7,"Antibiotic resistance kills more people a year than HIV/AIDs or malaria, especially in low and middle income countries. This grant will be used to extend the reach of our existing decentralized innovation program and support even more open science projects in Africa. 

Objectives of the Giant Lab:

Fight antimicrobial resistance in low and middle income countries (starting with Africa) 
For this we are:
Nurturing a network of scientists, engineers and NGOs who collaborate 
Developing Open source solutions (for prevention, diagnostic and treatment)
Providing a MOOCs to improve understanding in antibiotic resistance 

So far: 

In the first wave of our “Africa against antibiotic resistance” program, with just 5000 euros,
we mobilized more than 200 scientists from Sub-Saharan Africa (mostly Nigeria, Tanzania, Ghana and Uganda), 
We supported the creation of 9 projects and created an educational MOOC facilitating the training of 89 participants whom have gone on to further success professionally, with some participants now part of government-funded PhD programmes, becoming advocates of open science and antibiotic resistance . 

With this grant: 

We seek to expand the network to 500 members
We will support at least 10 open science projects using our microgrant approach
We will enrich the existing MOOC even more to provide educational and data resources for underfunded and undertrained professionals online

Budget

We have two initial goals for this grant: 10000 dollars and 30000 dollars. If we get more, the extra funding will go in priority to supporting even more projects. 

Microgrants [50%]
Incentivizing the project holders using microgrants (up to 2000 dollars) for validated projects - this goes a long way in the global south.
Organization of two rounds (one every 3 months)

JOGL Operations and Infrastructure [50%]
Community mobilization and animation 
Creation of the program flow for applicants
Mobilization campaign (graphics and social media)
Support to the community (community events)
Digital Infrastructure Development 
Support of the continuous improvement of the JOGL open source infrastructure
Maintenance of the platform
Fellowship and Leadership of programme 
Evaluation of the community program 
Sharing of the observation as a public report after 1 year of activity
Creation of the program flow for applicants
Analysis and sharing of peer-review results 

Background

Over the past decade, Antibiotic resistance has become a major global development issue, threatening environmental, veterinary, and human health. Antibiotics are potent tools against bacterial infections, however microorganisms previously known to be sensitive to some antimicrobial agents are developing partial to complete resistance against them. This can be combated using traditional academic techniques and is already being researched by many labs across the world, however global health and research capacity is not uniform. Development of systems, more open to medical labs and community labs, where universities are less concentrated is essential. This capacity can be granted through proper application of open science, and connection of these communities online, such as that of our project. We aim to develop open and taught materials and a database for tracking of antibiotic resistance  by the international community sustainably. Then use this model to scale up community lab capacity and independence. We have created a method of “Community Review” whereby applicants have say in grant outcomes, and a decentralized community is formed.
Open science is a global movement that aims to make scientific research and its findings accessible to the general public. Its collaborative and participatory ethos presents an opportunity for a bottom-up approach to research and development that is beneficial to the public. It embraces digital technologies to build communities, work processes, and tools, while embracing frugal innovation achieving significant results with minimal resources. We have already achieved this, through a global program to great effect with minimal funding during the COVID19 pandemic with OpenCOVID19, we can repeat this on antibiotic resistance  to create a grass roots antibiotic resistance  surveillance community.

Specific Aims
Improve our society’s resiliency to biothreats by increasing our antibiotic research capacity, especially against local resistance which can become a global problem. This is through empowerment of local peoples to do their own research - through a “community review” grant allocation.
Track new emergence of antibiotic resistance through community science and continue the creation of an emerging antibiotic resistance database 

The model in this proposal, whereby enthusiastic individuals are trained and selectively given funds to improve the world and community aims to build a more just and sustainable world, by doing more with less, for enthusiastic and under represented people.

7405,Web3 Talks: Stories & Tips from the Builders,0,0x3e6c23CdAa52B1B6621dBb30c367d16ace21F760,"Web3 Talks is a place where web3 founders from projects such as Zapper, Tally & HopProtocol share stories behind their projects and lessons they learned along the way.

Why have I started this project last year?

Well…

Web3 has rewritten many rules about building products, acquiring users & collaboration. Composability, open data, airdrops, tokens, DAOs – all these things can be confusing even for web3 native people, let alone builders who are just entering the space.

That's why almost a year ago, I started Web3 Talks, a podcast where web3 builders share their experiences to inspire the next generation of founders.

Seb Audet, Co-Founder @ Zapper explaining how they choose which features to include in v2:


As we're focused on builders, we don't talk high-level VC stuff like ""What is Metaverse?"" or trading-oriented things such as ""Which coin should you invest in 2022?"". Instead, we focus on questions such as ""How have you acquired your first users?"", ""How do you take care of your community?"" or ""What were the biggest technical challenges you've faced so far?

Chris Whinfrey, Founder @ Hop Protocol explaining how they protected their airdrop from Sybil attackers:


I have already recorded 27 episodes. I spoke with founders of smaller projects and with well-known founders such as Seb Audet (Zapper.fi), Dennison Bertram (Tally.xyz), Chris Whinfrey (Hop Protocol), Auston Bunsen (QuickNode) & Austin Griffith (Scaffold.ETH).

The podcast has 1,2k subscribers across the 3 biggest podcasting platforms (Spotify, Apple, Google) and has been well-received by the builder's community.


Madhavan Malolan, Founder @ Questbook explaining what helped them to build a 15,000 developers community in 2,5 months:


Since the start of last year, I have treated this podcast as a side project I financed from my pocket. But this model has its limits. So if I received a grant, I could dedicate more time to record more episodes, organize all the lessons shared by the builders so far, and promote the podcast around builder's communities.

7404,Proxify DAO - Gitcoin Funding Proposal,0,0x35936b4A3C4fb6fFa4F638f19f66105Af8EBfB60,"About Proxify DAO
 
Origin Story:
	The world’s unemployment rate has continued to surge (especially in Africa). It has seen a dramatic increase from 5.4% in 2020 to up to 33.51% in 2022.
	We underwent surveys and found out that this high unemployment rate was not so much a result of unemployability (in the form of poor education or illiteracy in tech) but mostly due to the unavailability of native job offerings.
	This prompted us to create a DAO whose major goal is eradicating unemployment in Africa and the world by teaching, connecting, and providing job opportunities by annexing the decentralised digital market. 
	ProXify DAO aims to do this by educating and onboarding contributors majorly from Africa and then the rest of the world to maximise, improve, upscale and apply their skills in Web3.
 
What is ProXify DAO? 
	ProXify DAO is a service DAO that educates, trains and mentors contributors to become skilled Web3 technical service providers; and ultimately connects them to clients (organizations, other DAOs, etc.) that require their services.
	We believe that the future of work is decentralised; and by utilising the DAO model, we assemble and train a community of the best service providers (ranging from writers, designers, developers, researchers, product testers, to marketers, etc.).
	By collaboratively sharing workspaces, resources, knowledge, and training contributors willing to upskill, we contribute to the future of Web3.
 
Problem Statement 
The unemployment rate has been a major concern in the world (Africa especially)
Monopolised Web2 companies require unreasonable certified qualifications compared to the pay.
	Organizations also find it difficult to access quality services that they require, having to go through strenuous recruitment/application processes to get the job done right.
	We, therefore, noticed the gap between these organizations and creative/technical services.
 
Solution 
 ProXify DAO bridges this gap by:
training and educating unskilled contributors trying to upskill;
reaching out to and onboarding skilled service providers previously oblivious about the concept of decentralization and DAOs;
onboarding skilled Web3 contributors; 
sourcing for organizations that need specific jobs done;
applying for these jobs as a service DAO;
employing the respective skilled contributors to carry out the job within the agreed timeframe;
getting the job done!
 
Notable Accomplishments: 
ProXify DAO has accomplished these within a month of its launch:
onboarded over 100 skilled contributors and according to our survey, 23 were entirely new to the concept of Web3;
we have bountied and paid out tasks to engage our community;
we formed a partnership with Domain DAO, handling their digital marketing (within this period, they generated over 400 $ETH in Juicebox contributions; even amidst a bear market!).
 
Funding Breakdown: 
Funds received in the GR15 will be used directly to support operations within the ProXify DAO. This will include;
Creation of an official ProXify DAO website; 
Onboarding check 
To help the grow the ProXify Community by providing funds for bounties to keep the community motivated.
To help create an extensive web3 course and Educational App.
 
Proxify DAO will like to thank the proxify community for their support and hopes you will join the proxify mission.",Valid Ethereum Address. 
7334,🧠 NeuraDAO: The Future of Neuroscience Research,0,0xC3B288170D923094f36120C9Ede5a4f141f308ba,"It took Einstein 14 years to develop the General Theory of Relativity. If he was born in the 21st century, there's doubt such a theory would've been created.

Here's why:

Government grants --the main way that research is funded-- suck at funding and realizing neurotech research into products. The current process to get grants is slow, bureaucratic, fragmented and can take up to 50% of a professor’s time. As a result, neurotech lags behind typical innovation and commercialization in biotech. Additionally, you must repeatedly apply for grants every 2-5 years leading to short-sighted research.

Less than 10% of data collected by publicly funded research in the US is published alongside their papers. An average of 70% of researchers have failed to replicate their colleagues’ work across disciplines. - OpSci

This issue drastically affects the neurotech space as there is a scarcity of high-quality data for research. In addition, the current structures in academia deters researchers from sharing their data due to a lack of incentives or security. Even when data is shared, it is not guaranteed to be useful.

Putting these two issues together, it’s difficult for any revolutionary scientific progress to be achieved in this academic ecosystem.
There isn’t a question of how many Einsteins there are in the world. The question is How many Einsteins are lost in the current world of academia

At NeuraDAO, we want to support talented researchers who are doing work in neurotech that will change the world. We do this by creating incentives to create and share high-quality data (via the NeuraDAO data marketplace), as well as creating more sustainable funding models for researchers. We hope our support will go towards creating long-term research and much-needed tooling, as well as bringing more accessibility and interoperability to neurotech data.
We also plan to support the DeSci ecosystem by funding conferences, and “hacker houses” such as the potential NeuraHouse in ETHLisbon 2022.

It can not only make the filecoin system more readable and user-friendly, but also become an important infrastructure for web3.
 
What can FNS do?
 
- FNS provides a secure and decentralized way to resolve on-chain and off-chain address resources on the Filecoin network into simple human-readable domain names.
 
- Users can use FNS as an identity to access the web3 world, and only need to integrate the DNS domain name into FNS, and their domain name can be used as a wallet, Web3 username and a decentralized website.
 
- For payment, users can use FNS to transfer native FIL assets. By simply connecting FNS to DNS, transactions can be sent to specific websites for payment without going through a payment middleman.
 
- Decentralized network, FNS addresses can be used with IPFS/Filecoin. For example, websites can be stored on IPFS/Filecoin by connecting FNS or integrating into DNS to IPFS/Filecoin. FNS provides decentralized domain name services, while IPFS/Filecoin is a decentralized file storage system, which together constitute a decentralized network.
 
- Text record feature enables FNS users to add various information to FNS records.
For example: email address, url, avatar, description, notifications, keywords, Github username, etc.
 
some new ideas
- FNS can be bound with the file CID, and the file search process can be optimized to optimize the user search experience.
 
- Use FNS to create bookmark bar, favorite system, and optimize the file management mode in Filecoin storage system.
 
- Use FNS to build a Web3 personal resume system.
 
At the same time, FNS also joined the early builder program of FVM Foundry officially launched by Filecoin.

Lack of global opportunities
Historically, iGEM teams have been affiliated with universities capable of providing mentorship and summer lab access. Not all universities have the resources to support these teams, which unfortunately leaves many students without access to the competition.

Opening access
LabDAO aims to launch a decentralized iGEM team to allow students from anywhere in the world to come together online and compete, regardless of their geographic or economic circumstances.

Talented students will be invited to join this global team, where they will have access to experienced mentors and resources needed to invent new synthetic biology applications. 

How will funds be used?
Funds raised by this Gitcoin grant will cover registration costs, laboratory expenses, and will help send team members to the 2023 iGEM International Jamboree to present their work in person. This unique experience will give the scholars a chance to develop a professional network in their field, practice their science communication skills, and celebrate their achievements.

With any additional funding LabDAO hopes to support students who could not otherwise commit to the project full-time during the summer for financial reasons. True decentralization means creating opportunities for everyone.

7338,Impacta Finance: Scaling Web3 Impact Initiatives,0,0x34B9bc5132319B38Cd0E6Bc812ad6a40bA7AaDB2,"Impacta Finance was created to scale web3 impact organizations through an index to evaluate and monetize digital assets that have a significant positive impact on people, communities, and the environment.
 
We are building tools to boost liquidity, coordination, and confidence in the Regenerative Finance market, with a focus on tokens designed to back real natural assets and projects that promote positive solutions using web3 tools. 
 
 
Problems 🚩
Despite the growing interest in metaverses, NFTs, and fungible assets, as well as impact solutions that are becoming increasingly successful, it remains extremely frustrating to browse, purchase and undertake the intersection between web3 and the ESG sectors.
 
The biggest problems are mainly related to:
 
The difficulty of interacting with decentralized finance solutions. 

Missing and overloaded information and the inability to find assets, stocks, and relevant content on web3 and ESG.

Lack of interest and liquidity from the crypto crowd for impact tokens and web3 solutions.
 
It is time-consuming, frustrating, and incomprehensible for those who are not living in both sectors.
 
 
Solutions 💡
Impacta was designed to scale both web3 and ESG sectors, reducing entry barriers for investors and entrepreneurs interested in innovative decentralized impact solutions.
 
We want to tackle these problems by providing an impactful web3 knowledge and entertainment hub and an instrument for direct exposure to the sector. 
 
The index was created to scale investment opportunities and the liquidity of projects that have the potential to transform the world for the better.
 
 
The 3 goals ♻️
 
Accelerate impact: accelerate projects promoting a positive impact on the web3, providing networking, solutions, and access to human and capital.

Increase Adoption: expand the exposure and liquidity of impact initiatives, increasing adoption of this asset class to transform them into a top leader class. 

Make impact hype: through communities, memes, colors, and entertainment, we want to make impact fun again.
 
 
What are we doing? 🌎
Impacta is focused on 4 action fronts to scale web3 impact initiatives:
 
1. Mapping: Through the Impact & Web3 Database, built collaboratively with other DAOs, we map in a continuous, structured, and unified way, the existing bases on impact and web3 with a unitary taxonomy.

2. Scoring & Tracking: Development of a methodology, created for both users with no prior knowledge and crypto natives, so that they can learn in real-time about the most promising initiatives in the sector, through a scoring that takes into account numerous variables, such as security, innovation, liquidity, impact, and financial return.

3. Exposure & aggregate tools: We focus on assets that hold real value such as Carbon, Water, Renewable Energy, and Recycling Certificates, among other nature-backed digital assets and tokens with real impact use cases. We want to create the ground for additional DeFi instruments for impact tokens such as ETFs, futures, and other derivatives, in order to scale their impact, capitalization, and adoption.

4. Web3 transition: Drive the digital transition and scale operational and early-stage organizations that are already solving real-world problems, with a strong focus on real assets, such as forests, water, food, electronic waste, and solutions for global problems, such as erosion of sociability, financial segregation, and obesity.

 
What we have been working on 🏗
1. Mapping
Collaborative database to map web3 projects, currencies, and initiatives with positive impact. The Impact & Web3 Directory is built collaboratively and has a detailed, and structured taxonomy.
 
Impact & Web3 Directory: We have joined forces with ReFi DAO to curate an open database of web3 projects that exist to create an impact on people and the planet. We have combined datasets across different organizations involved to create a unified database that will act as a public good for the space. We currently have over 400 unique projects in this database.

Building with ReFi DAO, @aleborda, @climateXcrypto, @cyrusofeden, @merlinwizz
 
2- Scoring & Tracking
Development of a methodology, created for both users with no prior knowledge and crypto natives, so that they can learn in real-time about the most promising initiatives in the sector, through a scoring that takes into account numerous variables, such as security, innovation, liquidity, impact certificates, and performance.
 
ReFi Rate-Athon: A rating event in partnership with Prime DAO, and ReFi DAO to help build trust in the ReFi space and encourage capital to flow to high-integrity projects. By creating an open framework for evaluation and rewarding researchers for their analysis—we built an MVP of a curated list of verified ReFi projects so that founders, talent, and investors can make sense of where to invest their time, energy, and capital.

Building with Prime Ratings, PrimeDAO, ReFi DAO
 
3- Exposure & aggregate tools
Allow access and exposition to the already curated base and tokens that live on different blockchains, in a simple, fun, and memetic way.
 
Positive Index: The Positive Index is an Open Source index that measures the positive impact of crypto assets and their performance to increase the exposure of an index that will rank companies in terms of their initiatives related to the environment, and governance (ESG), based on specific impact parameters.

Building with 2TM, Mercado Bitcoin, Nossa Terra Firme, Idesam
 
4- Web3 transition
Drive the web3 transition to achieve scalability of operational and early-stage organizations that are already solving real-world problems, with a strong focus on real assets, such as forests, water, food, and electronic waste, and global problems, such as erosion of sociability, financial inclusion, and obesity.
 
Impacta Podcast: Impacta Podcast is focused on exploring real impact use cases that are scaling through web3 tooling and technologies. We publish content especially in Portuguese, as we feel the gap between the Brazilian audience in the ReFi and positive impact spaces inside crypto. One of our main goals with the content we produce is to engage, increase participation, and invite the Latin American crowd to the impact revolution.

Building with Gaia Greentech, Barterchain, Celo Foundation
 
 
We believe that ROI and positive impact can be in symbiosis and that nothing will be more valuable than the assets that allow a good existence on earth.

Description
Problem statement
We are exploring a decentralized digital social network. By building a next-generation NFT architecture based on resource-oriented chains to express various social relationships and interactions in the Web3 world, and asset all this, so that the value of social capabilities of every participant could be confirmed and clarified.
PunStar is an initial form of this social network. Firstly, we will build this platform on Flow due to its unique resource-oriented features and next this will be extended to more resource-oriented chains like Aptos and Sui. Besides static content features and combinability of normal NFT, we take advantage of resource mechanisms to coalesce some innovative properties into NFT and asset them. The innovative properties include dynamical social relationships between participants established by resource interactions, executable abilities based on methods bound to resources (some of which have realistic meanings, e.g. advertising), and upgradeable features like Funny index which may actually increase NFT's value.
In this stage, PunStar chooses Funny things as the entry point of the social network, which could be easily extended in the future. The participants of PunStar are called ""Punsters"" (an NFT) and they can share their funny things in the form of ""Duanji"" (an NFT). Each person can express their preference for a ""Duanji"", which can stimulate the construction of social relationships between participants and let it possible to estimate the ""funny index"" of each ""Punster"". The ""Punsters"" can make content promotions(e.g. publish ads) based on their relationship constructed in PunStar, which needs to satisfy some restrictions based on the ""funny index"" first. We use resource mechanisms to coalesce social relationships, content promotion, and some other practical abilities into NFT, which is a great enhancement to the existing NFT, allowing NFT to be more realistic and of greater practical value.
Highlights
Brings associativity abilities to NFT with related assetization
As we know, on resource-oriented chains things can be bound to each resource, so resources can actually have their own abilities, such as social relationships based on the following mechanism. This is very different from the smart-contract-based chains where everything is published on smart contracts. Resources can be exchanged, so the bound abilities such as relationships can be exchanged too. This improves the potential value of the Punster NFT, as relationships can be combined with the advertising ability for instance. Punsters with more followers might be more valuable.
Brings execution abilities to NFT: Such as advertisement mechanism
Punsters can push advertisements to their followers with limitations of some conditions based on the funny index mechanism. This is a demonstration of a specific feature of resource-oriented NFT, which is the implementation of executable abilities bound to NFTs.
Brings dynamical growth abilities for NFT
Some dynamic abilities of Punsters could grow as they make contributions. For example, the funny index will increase if someone's Duanji is commended by others. And the funny index will influence the cooling time of Punster's advertising ability.
Assetization of all the social capabilities in PunStar
Assets in PunStar can be accessed Omnichain
Interesting things should be shared with others. Users can enjoy some special abilities of PunStar deployed on resource-oriented chains from other chains without losing the specific features of resources.
Background
Target audience:
Everyone can share funny things with each other, and enjoy funny stories from other punsters. So this is a product for every socialized humanity.
Evidence for the need:
We can find some similar successful products in the Web2 world, such as Facebook, Twitter, WeChat Friend Circle, etc. But there're some uncomfortable things in the Web2 world that the ownership, control, and disposal of assets do not belong to individuals. PunStar starts building its social platforms with funny topics, at the same time, social relations and advertising mechanisms were created based on the full use of resource features.
Proposed solution
Product

People publish Duanji to share funny things.
If one person thinks some other punsters are interesting, he can follow them to get the newest information as soon as the following punsters publish any updates.
If one person likes a Duanji, he can commend it, so that, the ""Funny Index"" of the Duanji will be increased, and the related punster who published the Duanji.
Punsters can push advertisements to their followers based on the funny index.
Both Duanji and Punster are NFTs that can be exchanged between different participants.
Besides resource-oriented chains like Flow, Aptos, and Sui, we are trying to provide advertising access interfaces to other chains, without losing the unique resource features.
Technology Architecture
 The key points of the technology are as follows:
Duanji is our new architecture NFT compatible with ERC series standard. Besides static content properties, Duanji has its dynamic feature funny index.
Punster is our new architecture NFT compatible with ERC series standard, and it is also an NFT container. A Punster NFT can contain lots of Duanji NFTs. The dynamic properties of Punster include
Following mechanism can be implemented easily based on resource interactions.
Funny index evaluation algorithm in the Commend mechanism can make out an estimation of how funny a Duanji or a Punster is, which depends on both commending counts and time passed.
Advertisement mechanism based on funny index of Punsters.
StarRealm and Cross-Chain Locker provide a Star Port for NFTs to travel to other chains.
Marketing
The funny Duanji is used as the initial entry point for the topic to start the market.
Give NFT more dynamic and practical value based on resource-oriented mechanisms to attract more users to create to build their social relationships.
Assetization the practical value of both Duanji and Punster NFTs, and make everything tradable, so that to improve the activity of PunStar platform.
Bring in more dynamical and practical abilities to Punster and Duanji NFT, such as E-commerce.
Besides funny things, bring in more topics like dating to inspire users to enhance their social relationships.

And we will aggregate the knowledge from the growing biocommunity and openbio projects, which DNA information as the cornerstone. Scientists, non-traditional bioresearchers, and citizen bio explorers can be connected together through the genomic information they both focus on and annotated with.


Empower people to share synthetic biology-related genomic information with ownership and the possibility of community building through the common interest.


The cost of sequencing, synthesis, and editing DNA dropping rapidly and the new bioecolonomy is rising


People now can be much easier to get into biotechnology development due to the lower cost of DNA sequencing, important bio patents expired, open-hardware movement, 3D printer technology, and wetware distribution (freegene project, iGEM, addgene....). The growing biocommunity expanded globally and there are almost a hundred of DIYbio labs. People are willing to share synthetic biology knowledge. Most of that information is related to genomic information and annotation. And there are lacking good ways to empower people to share and keep the ownership of this precious knowledge, such as a certain modification of the promoter region with A-> T can improve enzyme production to another level. This pain point is what pRoots designed to solve and bring web3 technology to accelerate the people to sharing certain genomic knowledge related to synthetic biology and be connected together due to the census interesting in certain regions of DNA sequencing (beer brewers exchange certain yeast genomic information through annotation in a similar region and be connected together).

Biolog is coded and programmed in DNA. 

Biology is software encoded in DNA. And most of the information is not easy to store, share, and annotated in a more open manner. Most of the genomic information is stored by the governments and traditional academics (such as NCBI and Ensembl)  In another way, as more and more DAOs raise funds for bioscience development and decentralized science, there will be also the necessity to build the infrastructure to deal with the related genomic data. pRoots will let biolabs, DAOs, and amateur bioscientists easily allocate the web3 resource as the functionality to deal with their sharable knowledge of genomic information.


Basic usage of pRoots can do to build a community around genomic data sharing 


DeSci DAOs can use pRoots to construct their funded research group to share their genomic data 


Curated and bridge the open science into sharable knowledge and people can annotate and interacte with it




Phase 1

people will use pRoots to store DNA data (fasta, fastq, bam) as easily as possible in a decentralized storage system.
enable DAOs and scientists who received crypto funds can use our tools to store, share and annotate their genomic data in a web3 manner
people can view their DNA data such as plasmids from a browser with a useful viewer and store the metadata in a decentralized way

Phase 2
provide an interactive way to let the genomic metadata connected and sharable, and aggregate the current important synthetic biology open plasmid data to bridge the web3 and current biocommunity.
bridging the current open bio community such as global biocommunity, freegan, iGEM to provide they to use this tool to store, share, and annotate in pRoots

Phase 3

provide API to let DAOs, other web3 service to create smart contract with genomic data request

中文版介紹

pRoots是為了賦予人們能方便儲存、分享、註釋和學習基因資料並建立信譽的去中心化工具，最終目標是希望建立以基因資訊為媒介的合成生物學開源合作網絡。

近五年以來，基因科技的進步，除了讓基因定序、合成和修改基因的成本大幅下降，加速了使用生物技術來解決農業、食物、能源、醫療、材料的機會，除此之外，自造者運動、便宜的3D列印風氣，帶起草根生技創業的趨勢。其中一個會遇到的問題是，許多重要的基因資料，沒有一個好的方式能分享基因資料和註解。許多生物開源實驗室願意分享，但在跨國經費和資料分享上，相對困難，而如今區塊鏈技術建立起了網路原生金融體系，和去中心化的儲存設施剛好可以打破這障礙。

另外，今年開始許多專注在生醫領域之去中心化的自治組織(DAOs)開始出現，像是MoleculeDAO、LabDAO、BioDAO
、VitaDAO、ValleyDAO等等，主要以使用加密貨幣進行生醫研究贊助，目前處理細節的工具尚無出現，而 pRoots 便能用來提供DAO在贊助研究後，讓研究產出的基因資訊，能使用貢獻到開源的知識基因網絡上。同時，贊助的數位貨幣也能很原生地提供給相對應的研究團隊或個人。

社區營造
會使用瀏覽器為主的元宇宙房間Portal，來定期舉辦跟合成生物學、基因體學和生物資訊內容的分享，和特定基因資訊之策展。
邀請@chosbeagle來幫忙連結台灣的iGEM團隊，且規劃是否未來有機會能提供一筆永續資金來幫助台灣iGEM團隊，作為回饋，讓他們使用pRoots來分享儲存基因資訊，下一步則希望可以幫助國際iGEM團隊，且促使他們將相關基因資訊以去中心化分享。
藉由這次機會，希望能從Contributors中找到對於此項目方向和主題有興趣的夥伴，看是否能做一些基於基因生技、合成生物學主題的分享和定期輸出。


階段一
能讓科學家、開源實驗室或是公民科學家使用pRoots儲存、分享並且註釋基因資訊。
介面提供簡易的基因資料視覺化和編輯工具。
能讓DAOs使用pRoots提供資助對象相關基因資料的基本設施功能，如儲存、分享和註釋。

階段二
提供一個基因資料分享網絡，讓人跟人可以藉由註釋或是分享類似基因資訊而形成關係，建立於基因共享興趣的合作網路（研究啤酒酵母基因的人們可以因此發現彼此）。
建立一個連結開源生物領域工具和資料網站的資料結構，並且建立類似基因策展的基因，能將一些很棒的開源基因資料，從web2橋接到web3的世界，並且人們可以在這些知識上面形成社交網絡和註釋。

階段三
將pRoots的API設計完成，讓DAOs可以使用pRoots的API來進行資料合約，比如將贊助的加密貨幣，一部分已儲存空間的方式給予贊助對象，但合約條件為對象必須將相關基因資料產出分享到pRoots搭建的知識網絡。
個人也可以藉由pRoots的API進行資料合約，比如位在歐洲的啤酒酵母業餘科學家，想要委託墨西哥社區實驗室的科學家定序當地酵母菌基因，便能藉由pRoots API進行鍊上資料合約。




P.S: 團隊認為去中心化科學是亞洲區域蠻好的機會，一方面，科學是一個相對超越國家文化的語言，只要能打造和提供一個解決目前科學民主化或是開放的障礙，那麼市場接受度應該是可以期待的，基因科技是這時代生技核心，所以解決基因科技開放化的問題，將會促進科學交流，以及生技開發的速度。

2022.09.15 很感謝許多亞洲在鏈圈的朋友贊助，這主題關於生物資訊和基因應該對大部分的鏈圈朋友不熟悉，還能獲得支持，讓人對以太坊生態係很敬佩，也會努力帶進來一些不一樣的東西。

2022.09.17 團隊的@chaosbeagle 開始跟成大和陽明的iGEM團隊接洽，看是否能幫助他們明年的比賽，同時，我們也跟@shasta_bio看能否幫助他的開放生物獎金，他希望獎助做全世界最大細胞(藻類)的研究，然後讓參與者使用pRoots來分享儲存基因相關資料。目標是將原本不熟悉區塊鏈社群的開源生物科學社群帶入！

2022.09.18 連繫到中正iGEM團隊老師，有興趣了解pRoots能怎麼幫助他們學生團隊，會安排視訊會議。

2022.09.19 進一步接洽中山醫、陽明醫的iGEM團隊。

2022.09.20 跟中正iGEM團隊開會，同時，參加plackerDAO twitter space分享項目

2022.09.21 參加陽明iGEM說明會，跟帶隊老師說明和分享pRoots

2022.9.22 中正iGEM願意接受pRoots協助，分享至少讓18位同學學習到區塊鏈、gitcoin和如何使用這工具來幫助他們日後的科學活動，在規劃輔助他們參加下一屆gitcoin的募資

Yaqu Pacha Uruguay is a civil non-profit organization dedicated to implementing and promoting projects for the protection, conservation, and study of aquatic mammals in Uruguay and the South Western Atlantic ocean. 

One of the main projects is the Toninas Project) carried out since 2002, regarding the research and conservation of the recently recognized subspecies Lahille’s bottlenose dolphin Tursiops truncatus gephyreus (known as “Tonina” in Uruguay), along the Uruguayan oceanic coast, an endangered species of the Southwestern Atlantic Ocean. This project addresses population ecology, social and acoustic behavior, habitat use, and movements of Lahille’s bottlenose dolphins along the Uruguayan oceanic coast. 

Since 2018, Yaqu Pacha Uruguay has collaborated with Brazilian researchers in the Gephyreus Project. The goal of this project is to estimate the total abundance of Lahille's bottlenose dolphin in southern Brazil and Uruguay and to assess its risk of extinction (founded by Yaqu Pacha Germany, totally granted 2021 for Uruguayan counterpart $5000).

Our last project (2021-2022), funded by ECCOSUR (grant received: USD 10.000) was “Lahille's bottlenose dolphin the coastal sentinel: tourism, environmental education, and integrated management”. This project involved a vulnerability analysis of climate change effects on Lahille’s bottlenose dolphin, as well as a promotion of the species as a sentinel and flag species of the Uruguayan oceanic coast. We engaged educators and schoolchildren in various areas of the country, mainly on the coast, tourist operators, and other local actors in environmental education activities to increase their awareness of the problems faced by the coastal system due to the effects of climate change and in particular, to see their effects on the Lahille’s bottlenose dolphin. 

In Uruguay, the Lahille’s bottlenose dolphin population is small (approximately 70 individuals), has a restricted distribution, and is extremely coastal. It also has a high residence of photo-identified individuals, and high mobility waters of the Río de la Plata estuary and southern Brazilian waters, where there is high mortality in artisanal fishing nets. In addition, this population belongs to the same management unit and evolutionary unit as the dolphins from southern Brazil, showing low genetic diversity. Due to all of the above, the dolphin was included in the list of priority species for the conservation of the National System of Protected Areas of Uruguay. The results of the investigations also contributed to the recognition of this dolphin as a subspecies and for its evaluation by the IUCN in the Vulnerable category. Although very little information exists on possible direct and indirect threats to the subspecies in Uruguayan waters, contamination from agricultural effluents could be a source of concern due to the pollutant load detected in other marine organisms in areas of the high occurrence of Lahille’s Bottlenose Dolphins. Reduced prey availability caused by overfishing and destruction of benthic ecosystems due to fisheries is other possible threats for the subspecies in Uruguay. Incidental capture of Lahille’s Bottlenose Dolphins in fishing gear in Uruguay is rare. However, in the last 2 years, at least five animals were recorded stranded, two of them with bycatch signs from fishing nets located 300m from the coast (“subsistence fishery”).


Our main priorities are:

-To resume systematic boat surveys between La Paloma and Punta del Diablo (principally Esmeralda-south to Cabo Polonio) for photo-id and acoustic records. Catalog update. Population monitoring

-To make a new abundance estimate on the Uruguayan coast as well as other population parameters (survival, birth interval, movement patterns, residency). 

-To get in-depth about the effects of Climate Change on dolphin occurrence and distribution. 
 
-To test hypotheses regarding the occurrence of dolphins and coastal upwellings.

-To continue coordinated efforts with Brazil, focusing on whistle analysis, especially of signature whistles and catalog construction, social structure analysis, and individual movement analyses.

-To start studies regarding contaminant levels in the tissues of dolphins.

-To biopsy samples for genetic, social structure, and forging ecology studies.

-To include an anthropological perspective for historical data on the occurrence of Lahille’s bottlenose dolphin in Rio de la Plata Estuary.
-To monitor mortality (Stranding network).

-To promote citizen science: records of dolphins by citizens all along the Uruguayan coast

-To keep visiting local schools to engage schoolchildren in environmental education activities.

-To keep raising awareness of the effects of climate change on Lahille’s bottlenose dolphin population and the importance of conservation of the coastal marine ecosystem.

-To explore blockchain technology's potential to build up shared databases of photo-id and whistles catalogs between other research groups working on dolphin population
ons.


Impacts on the DeSci community
 
1. As one of the first Latin American projects in DeSci, we will contribute to enhancing awareness of the DeSci movement across these latitudes, which will promote its expansion and increase its diversity.
 
2. We will also contribute to opening DeSci to other different disciplines. Opening DeSci to conservation biology projects will also promote DeSci diversity and the inclusion of more descientists and different perspectives.
 
3. We will demonstrate the efficiency of quadratic funding as an alternative way of funding often underfunded projects such as those of non-profit, independent, research groups working on conservation biology and focusing on climate change effects on biodiversity.

Our collective sensemaking and epistemic commons are broken to such an extent the ability of our societies to coordinate in the face of existential crises is severely impaired. For more details, see our paper and video here.
One key cause is that the mechanisms for collective signalling (likes, comments, hashtags, and other forms of social annotation), and the algorithms that drive our collective behavior therefrom, are siloed away by centralized platforms whose primary incentives of corporate profit are misaligned with broader societal good.
These signals are a form of stigmergy, a foundational coordination mechanism in which individual signalling (such as pheromone trails in ants) drives emergent collective intelligent behavior.
The vital importance of stigmergic signals (or markers) to the health of our information ecosystems raises the question: what if not just our content, but our attention signals (aka stigmergic markers ) could be published in a decentralized form on a scale that would make interesting emergent innovation possible?
Algorithmically-aided collective behavior (e.g., sensemaking and collective intelligence applications) would then be available to anyone for experimentation, opening the door to impactful applications, as well as better scientific and ethical oversight over collective behavior.
Herein we propose to:
Create a schema/protocol for publishing such signals and providing open, decentralized and platform-agnostic access to them.
Bootstrap a large decentralized near-real-time corpus of annotation signals from existing social behavior, initially via Twitter’s API.
Create reference implementations of the kinds of open source attention applications made possible, e.g. aggregation of annotations to specific URLs, quality / reliability indicators for web content.

7596,Web3 Documentary About Nigerian Human Trafficking,0,0x33484678A59581100d6266d04910a7472eEF55B5,"TL;DR: Human trafficking is a problem in Nigeria. We asked traditional organizations for help but they declined. Web3 is making this documentary possible, which has become a part of the story itself. Our documentary educates communities about predatory practices used by traffickers and lays a blueprint for Nigerians to collaborate with Web3 to address local issues. 

The Problem: A Human Trafficking Crisis in Nigeria

Human trafficking is defined as the illegal trade of people for exploitation or commercial gain, constituting modern-day slavery. As of 2014 human trafficking represented a $150 billion global industry. Two-thirds of this figure ($99 billion) was generated from commercial sexual exploitation.

Nigeria remains an origin point, throughway, and destination country for human trafficking. Recent estimates suggest victims number over 1,386,000, ranking Nigeria in the 81st percentile compared to other countries. A 2003 report stated trafficking was so enmeshed in Benin City, Nigeria that most families had at least one member involved in trafficking as either a victim or trafficker. 

The long history of trafficking associated with this area in Nigeria persists to recent years. In 2017 over 75% of women migrants arriving in Italy were both victims of sexual exploitation and hailed from Edo State, which contains Benin City.
Victims of human trafficking experience horrific violence and hardship both on their journey to their destination country, and also when they arrive. Advocacy group Pathfinders reports individuals are abused physically, gang-raped, and infected with various sexually transmitted diseases. 

The U.S. State Department categorizes the Nigerian government as attempting but ultimately failing to comply with accepted standards for eliminating human trafficking.

Rejected By Trad Organizations, Embraced by Web3 

A group of Nigerian journalists led by Existential Zoomer set out to investigate human trafficking, highlight methods for prevention, and suggest how social programs can help survivors heal. 

When we reached out to traditional organizations in Nigeria to solicit funding for a documentary they declined, saying human trafficking is a “heavy topic.” Additionally, acknowledging human trafficking can be seen as indirectly critiquing the government and therefore carries political risk. 

Thus we turned to Web3 and found financial and technical support in PeopleDAO. Seed funding of $7.7k allowed us to travel to Benin City in early June and produce an initial report capturing the stories of survivors and analyzing the factors contributing to human trafficking.  

Crowdfunding a Documentary

Building on the momentum, we aim to produce a feature-length documentary, The Lost Children of Benin City, bringing attention to the social problem of women and children being trafficked in and out of Nigeria. We have partnered with a production company, Singularity Media, which has experience placing content on major streaming platforms. 

Web3 itself has become part of the story, because it provided us the support when traditional organizations would not. Nigerian art-makers cite a lack of interest and patronage from international players. Our documentary will expand the imagination of global audiences, providing the blueprint for more international collaboration to produce content about Web3’s relationship with Africa. 

Additionally, we will use the documentary to “sensitive” Nigerian communities, both urban and rural, teaching them about how to avoid tactics employed by human traffickers. In showing them the documentary we simultaneously affirm to Nigerian communities that Web3 holds value beyond being a medium for financial capital, but can also act as a vehicle for garnering support and creating social impact.

7597,"Scriptus, a marketplace for research as collectible art",0,0x1953fCeF1369df610B2407dBe5a4190535284D47,"What is Scriptus?
Scriptus is a marketplace for research as collectible art. From the researchers' perspective, Scriptus offers a drop-in replacement of traditional pre-print hosting platforms (e.g. arxiv.org), that also enables researchers to receive additional research funding with zero overhead (i.e. no gofundme page or additional grant proposals needed). 

For supporters of science, Scriptus offers a direct channel for them to support the research that they care about. Unlike donating to traditional non-profit scientific organizations, where only a fraction of the dollar donated goes towards researchers (the rest goes towards running the non-profit), when people support researchers on Scriptus, 100% of their money goes directly into the researcher's wallet. No more haircuts from intermediary institutions. 

Additionally, Scriptus provides a marketplace for people to trade their donations. This market mechanism enables two important functions. First, it injects long-term liquidity into the science funding infrastructure. Put simply, Scriptus makes it possible for future donors to support today’s scientific research. Secondly, it offers price discovery for research impact: higher impact research will receive more interest from supporters of science, and the market mechanism will drive the price higher. This price will in turn allow researchers to uncover higher impact papers more easily. 

How does Scriptus work? 
Researchers upload papers to Scriptus the same way as they do on traditional platforms, and Scriptus will in turn mint N-shares of fractional NFTs that represent that research project. Once the paper is uploaded, the content of the research is free for everyone, regardless of who owns the NFTs that represent the paper. Then, the researcher can list the NFTs for sale on the Scriptus marketplace, where supporters of science can discover and support the research project by purchasing the research NFT. Owners of existing research NFTs can also resell it anytime, effectively providing liquidity to science funding during the period of their ownership.

Why is Scriptus potentially impactful? 
We are excited about Scriptus because we think it can solve/improve the three causes of the stagnation we see in science today: long-term liquidity issue in science funding, misallocation of research funding and effort, and increased science friction. We had already briefly discussed how Scriptus enables long-term liquidity provision of research, and reduces science friction by making high impact research more visible. Scriptus additionally will help incentivize meaningful and important research by aligning the interests between researchers and the public. Traditional science funding sources are either highly influenced by special interests (i.e. industry funding typically focuses on narrow areas pertinent to the company’ product), or plagued by a very noisy and inefficient selection process. As a result, high impact projects are not being funded, and the selection process for grants and publications are weakly correlated with quality. By providing a direct channel between the public and the researchers, Scriptus allows the public to loudly voice their opinion on the most urgent research that needs to be funded first. 

For a more complete discussion of how Scriptus will accelerate the science progress, see https://github.com/ScriptusApp/whitepaper/blob/main/part1.pdf for our whitepaper.

Who are we?
The founder of Scriptus is Steven, who has recently completed his PhD in Operations Research at Columbia University, where he focused on various online learning and mechanism design problems. We also have the support of many professors and PhD students from various institutions including Columbia, Princeton, Stanford, and Harvard.

This grant is aimed at quality control of human verification methods that are used in Gitcoin passport. The goal is to measure how much it would cost to forge each of those methods. The measurement will be done through Upala’s price of forgery protocol. See Benefits of Price of Forgery for Gitcoin.

Money from this grant will be used exclusively to fill the pools. In short we gonna use this money to bribe bots away from Gitcoin and see which human verification methods are “cheaper”. Check out the video to learn more - how Price of forgery works.

And my dearest humans and bots please consider donating Upala itself as well. 

Gitcoin and Upala integration

In short Upala and Gitcoin integration looks as follows. Upala grabs users from GC passport, outputs liquidated bots and evaluates human verification methods. Gitcoin sends funds to it (like a service fee), tries to attract as many bots as possible and uses collected data to tweak trust bonus and sanction malicious actors.



Inputs:
Users. Users are fed from Gitcoin Passport. Upala learns which addresses  have which verification methods passed.
$$. Budget is allocated in pools in order for the protocol to work.
Outputs:
Bots. The list of liquidated bots. Sanctions to be applied to these users (should be restricted or deleted from Gitcoin).
HV PoFs. Price of Forgery for every human verification method. It makes sense to tie trust bonus to this data. Or use it for KPIs (🐚A follow up for the Green pilled episode with Upala)
Cheques. Liquidation cheques are used by bots to liquidate. Should be published somewhere public and promoted.

Measuring the PoFs is the first step

There’s definitely a lot of potential here for automation. We could automate trust bonus adjustments depending on PoF for example and do other cool stuff (see benefits). But it is not necessary to integrate full scale.

As a first step we can measure PoFs, get new insights (with the help of FDD team data) and decide on the next steps. We can do trust bonus setup and sanctioning in manual mode for now.

Details

Budgeting. Pools must be filled with real money. The way those funds are going to be spent are described here - 🧿Gentle PoF discovery methodology and budget.

Promotion. Bots need to know the rules of the game. And they need to be attracted. Promotion campaign is described here -💈Signalling bots (working document)

Ceres, the infrastructure of the Decentralized Credit System (DCS). The goal of Ceres is to construct the cornerstone of the future Web3 DeSoc (Decentralized Society), through a more comprehensive and fully open-source DCS.

Ceres now has 250,000 users already, since we launched Oracle Protocol V1 in April 2022. And we plan to reach 2,000,000 till Q2 2023. We will lanch credit model then. It would be the first trusted decentralized credit system, which not only valuate and estimate from on-chain address historial data, but also count on address-network data.
Ceres Solves
1#Ceres Oracle Protocol
Ceres scores credit through its open-source Oracle Protocol, from which users’ discounted cash flow (DCF) - a crucial part of one's DCS, can be efficiently and accurately analyzed and estimated.
DID System: Enrich the on-chain accounts’ status, and generate a virtuous circle with Ceres Oracle Protocol.

2#On-chain social graph quality and influence index
Ceres believes one‘s on-chain social graph quality and influence index are also key aspects evaluated in future Web3 DCS, therefore we enable a series of open-sourced smart contracts for users/ DApps/ DAOs to customize, and easily unlock one’s greater influence
We don't collect any sensitive information and it's difficult to store those in smart contracts
Ceres and Ceres' team doesn't have access to moderate your credit scoring, everything in your on-chain credit scoring is public and you are responsible for it

Governance community culture and participation, frameworks, infrastructure, and the toolings for community governance on Cosmos-based chains are severely lacking.

7560,AbjaDAO | Translating Blockchain to Arabic,0,0x776b3b6238CB38b55c7492824318ADAFA1e6fa45,"AbjaDAO | The DAO Translating Blockchain to Arabic

How to translate the word ‘Blockchain’ to Arabic? 13 years after Bitcoin was launched, somehow this question remains unanswered.

Some translators choose to Arabize the term, or type it with Arabic alphabets, so it sounds the same and maintains its global familiarity. But due to Arabic’s phonetic complexity, the word Blockchain can be spelled in either one of eight different ways: (بلوكتشين، بلوكشين، بلوكتشاين، بلوكشاين، بلوك شين، بلوك تشين، بلوك شاين، بلوك تشاين). Other translators tried to translate the word by searching for an Arabic equivalent. The most common translation today is (سلسلة الكتل), which translates back to English as ‘A Chain of Blocks’, more of an explanation than a translation.

But why is translating to Arabic this tricky? One way to approach this question is by comparing Arabic to Latin. At its peak, Latin was spoken to one extent or another across all of Europe, and the different European peoples started producing their local iterations from Latin, which developed with time to constitute new branched languages.

While Arabic went through a similar phase of popularity, political and cultural reasons dictated that Arabic shall remain one language with multiple dialects, and that these dialects shall not grow into new different languages. Today, one can argue that Moroccan Arabic and Saudi Arabic for instance are less intelligible than Italian and Spanish, however Moroccan and Saudi Arabic are treated as two dialects of the same language, while Italian and Spanish are considered to be two languages.

This is one major source of headache when it comes to translating to Arabic. We need to find a translation that works with people of different linguistic practices, a task that feels like coming up with a ‘European’ translation of the word Blockchain, one that works across the whole of Europe.

The lack of a unified reference for translating blockchain to Arabic has been causing a myriad of issues. On one hand, it created a linguistic bottleneck, keeping most of quality blockchain content away from mono-lingual Arabs. On the other hand, without a standardized way to spell or translate essential keywords, SEO efforts targeting Arab readers will be significantly compromised.

The cost of translating blockchain content to Arabic remains high, as businesses end up developing their own glossaries throughout the translation process, which was the case with both the Ethereum Foundation and Binance. These de facto glossaries, while filling a gap, can in fact, and unintentionally, amplify the problem by introducing translation dispersion, where one term has two translations in two different glossaries, and translation biases, such as regional bias, where a translation is better understood in one part of the Arab region over the rest.

Translation difficulties tend to lead to deeper issues, such as lack of proper blockchain literacy, both on technical and general levels, which allows for more misinformation and stigma around the technology and its uses. That’s why it’s no wonder that MENA (Middle East & North Africa), a region that houses over 570M residents, remains one of the slowest regions in terms of blockchain and crypto currencies adoption in the world.

In a nutshell, this is why AbjaDAO exists!

AbjaDAO is a guild-type special purpose DAO, it’s named after the Arabic alphabet, which is usually abbreviated as ABJAD (similar to ABC). AbjaDAO brings together four MENA-based blockchain-focused initiatives, around a plan to develop a decentralized and unified Arabic blockchain glossary.

Our DAO includes representatives from ZeFi, a 40-people strong research and media project specialized in Arabic blockchain content. ZeFi were working on their own expansive dictionary when AbjaDAO came together, and they shared with us hundreds of translated and explained terms to use as a cornerstone. The DAO also includes Arabs in Blockchain initiative, founded by Eman Herawy, an Ethereum fellow who played a leading role in translating Ethereum to Arabic. Tafkir, a research and public goods center that conceived AbjaDAO, bringing to the table experienced academic and literary translators. And DocStream, a collective of editorial and translation service providers that serve the British Council amongst other clients.

Together, and joined by individual experts and consultants, we conceived a plan to develop a unifying glossary for Arabic blockchain terminology. We began by surveying a large body of blockchain literature to extract a list of nearly 1,400 terms, words and abbreviations. We are currently working on sorting these terms by frequency of use, and grouping them into thematic patches. In parallel, we are conducting a series of workshops to settle on translation philosophy and approaches. If you are an Arabic reader, you can track our progress on both tracks here (Listing and Patching Table, Translation Philosophy).

In the next phase of the project, we will conduct 4-hour workshops bringing together 7 translation experts from within and outside the DAO. Those translators will tackle a thematic patch of terms in every workshop, submit their different translations, and settle on the best translation through discussion or voting.

But translation is only half the answer. The other half would be propagation. For our translations to get picked up and start replacing former dispersed translations, we plan to follow the release of the glossary with a propagation campaign, aiming at having the glossary adopted by: 5 Arab colleges, 2 mainstream and 10 alternative pan-Arab media outlets, 25 blockchain-focused social media pages and influencers and 5 Arabic UI / UX websites or apps. We also plan to set up a Wikipedia grant, motivating translators to bring 20 essential blockchain pages to Arabic, using our glossary through translation.

The glossary will be a public good, and accessible to all for free. We hope to publish the first version of the glossary with 600-1000 terms translated, sometime before the end of the year (for a more detailed timeline, check our presentation!). After the initial release, we plan to update the glossary on 6-9 months intervals.

So far, we have received funding from the Solana Foundation through Tafkir, we also received logistical support from the Ethereum Foundation, who are sharing with us their own glossary to use as a point of reference. But we need further funding to see this project through. To support our DAO or learn more on our progress, you can download this presentation.

7563,AbjaDAO | Translating Blockchain to Arabic,0,0x776b3b6238CB38b55c7492824318ADAFA1e6fa45,"How do we translate ‘Blockchain’ to Arabic? Thirteen years after Bitcoin was launched, somehow this question remains unanswered.

Some translators choose to transliterate the term, using Arabic script while preserving the sound and maintaining its global familiarity. Given the lack of uniform phonetic alphabet, however, the Arabized word can be spelled in either one of eight different ways: بلوكتشين، بلوكشين، بلوكتشاين، بلوكشاين، بلوك شين، بلوك تشين، بلوك شاين، بلوك تشاين. Other translators opt for an Arabic equivalent through literal translation. The most common translation today is سلسلة الكتل, which translates back to ‘The Chain of Blocks’, more of an explanation than a translation.

But why is translating to Arabic so tricky? Compare it with Latin. At its peak, Latin was spoken more or less across most of southern Europe, with the different Latin-speaking nations developing their own Latin vernaculars, which later evolved into brand new languages.

While Arabic went through a similar phase of popularity, a combination of cultural and geopolitical factors made Arabic one language with multiple dialects unable to grow into new distinct languages. One could argue that Moroccan Arabic and Saudi Arabic for instance are less mutually intelligible than Italian and Spanish, yet Moroccan and Saudi Arabic are treated as two dialects, especially given the shared literary space, while Italian and Spanish are two separate national languages.

This is one source of the headache felt by Arabic technology translators. They have to navigate different linguistic practices to arrive at terms working for all. This feels like coming up with a ‘European’ translation of the word Blockchain that works across the whole of Europe.

The lack of a unified reference for translating blockchain to Arabic has caused innumerable issues. On one hand, it created a linguistic bottleneck, keeping most of quality blockchain content away from mono-lingual Arabs. On the other, without a standardized spelling or translation of essential keywords, SEO efforts targeting Arab readers are significantly compromised.

The cost of translating blockchain content to Arabic remains high, as businesses end up developing their own glossaries throughout the translation process. This has been the case with both the Ethereum Foundation and Binance. These de facto glossaries, while filling a gap, can in fact unintentionally amplify the problem by introducing more dispersion, where one term has two translations in two different glossaries, and where uneven localizations, e.g. regional biases, mean that some translations are better understood in one part of the Arab region but not the others.

Translation difficulties tend to lead to deeper issues, including lack of blockchain literacy, both on technical and general levels, allowing for more misinformation and stigma around the technology and its uses. That’s why it’s no wonder that MENA (Middle East & North Africa), a region that houses over 570M residents, remains one of the slowest regions to adopt blockchain and crypto currencies in the world.

In a nutshell, this is why AbjaDAO exists!

AbjaDAO is a guild-type special purpose DAO named after the original order of the semitic alphabet - ABJAD is one way of saying ‘A-B-C-D-E’ in Arabic. AbjaDAO brings together four MENA-based blockchain-focused initiatives, with a view to developing a decentralized and unified Arabic blockchain glossary.

Our DAO includes representatives from ZeFi, a 40-people strong research and media project specialized in Arabic blockchain content. ZeFi were working on their own expansive dictionary when AbjaDAO came together, with their hundreds of translated and explained terms becoming AbjaDAO’s cornerstone. The DAO also includes Arabs in Blockchain initiative, founded by Eman Herawy, an Ethereum fellow who played a leading role in translating Ethereum to Arabic. Tafkir, a research and public goods center that conceived AbjaDAO, brings to the table experienced academic and literary translators, along with DocStream, a collective of linguists specialized in the social sciences and the humanities.

Together, and joined by individual experts and consultants, we put together a plan to develop a unified glossary for Arabic blockchain terminology. We began by surveying a large body of blockchain literature to extract a list of nearly 1,400 terms, phrases and abbreviations. We are currently working on sorting these terms by frequency of use, and grouping them into thematic patches. In parallel, we are conducting a series of workshops to settle on translation philosophy and approaches. 

In the next phase of the project, we will conduct 4-hour workshops bringing together 7 translation experts from within and outside the DAO. Those translators will tackle a thematic patch of terms in every workshop, submit their different translations, and settle on the best terminological choices through discussion or voting.

Translation, however, is only half the answer. The other would be propagation. For our translations to get picked up and start replacing former scattered terms, we plan to follow the release of the glossary with a propagation campaign, aiming at having the glossary adopted by: 5 Arab colleges, 2 mainstream and 10 alternative pan-Arab media outlets, 25 blockchain-focused social media pages and influencers and 5 Arabic UI / UX websites or apps.

AbjaDAO is a guild-type special purpose DAO, it’s named after the Arabic alphabet, which is usually abbreviated as ABJAD (similar to ABC). AbjaDAO brings together four MENA-based blockchain-focused initiatives, around a plan to develop a decentralized and unified Arabic blockchain glossary.

Our DAO includes representatives from ZeFi, a 40-people strong research and media project specialized in Arabic blockchain content. ZeFi were working on their own expansive dictionary when AbjaDAO came together, and they shared with us hundreds of translated and explained terms to use as a cornerstone. The DAO also includes Arabs in Blockchain initiative, founded by Eman Herawy, an Ethereum fellow who played a leading role in translating Ethereum to Arabic. Tafkir, a research and public goods center that conceived AbjaDAO, bringing to the table experienced academic and literary translators. And DocStream, a collective of editorial and translation service providers that serve the British Council amongst other clients.

Together, and joined by individual experts and consultants, we conceived a plan to develop a unifying glossary for Arabic blockchain terminology. We began by surveying a large body of blockchain literature to extract a list of nearly 1,400 terms, words and abbreviations. We are currently working on sorting these terms by frequency of use, and grouping them into thematic patches. In parallel, we are conducting a series of workshops to settle on translation philosophy and approaches. If you are an Arabic reader, you can track our progress on both tracks here (Listing and Patching Table, Translation Philosophy).

In the next phase of the project, we will conduct 4-hour workshops bringing together 7 translation experts from within and outside the DAO. Those translators will tackle a thematic patch of terms in every workshop, submit their different translations, and settle on the best translation through discussion or voting.

But translation is only half the answer. The other half would be propagation. For our translations to get picked up and start replacing former dispersed translations, we plan to follow the release of the glossary with a propagation campaign, aiming at having the glossary adopted by: 5 Arab colleges, 2 mainstream and 10 alternative pan-Arab media outlets, 25 blockchain-focused social media pages and influencers and 5 Arabic UI / UX websites or apps. We also plan to set up a Wikipedia grant, motivating translators to bring 20 essential blockchain pages to Arabic, using our glossary through translation.

The glossary will be a public good, and accessible to all for free. We hope to publish the first version of the glossary with 600-1000 terms translated, sometime before the end of the year (for a more detailed timeline, check our presentation!). After the initial release, we plan to update the glossary on 6-9 months intervals.

So far, we have received funding from the Solana Foundation through Tafkir, we also received logistical support from the Ethereum Foundation, who are sharing with us their own glossary to use as a point of reference. But we need further funding to see this project through. To support our DAO or learn more on our progress, you can download this presentation.

7561,AbjaDAO | Translating Blockchain to Arabic,0,0x776b3b6238CB38b55c7492824318ADAFA1e6fa45,"AbjaDAO | The DAO Translating Blockchain to Arabic

How to translate the word ‘Blockchain’ to Arabic? 13 years after Bitcoin was launched, somehow this question remains unanswered.

Some translators choose to Arabize the term, or type it with Arabic alphabets, so it sounds the same and maintains its global familiarity. But due to Arabic’s phonetic complexity, the word Blockchain can be spelled in either one of eight different ways: (بلوكتشين، بلوكشين، بلوكتشاين، بلوكشاين، بلوك شين، بلوك تشين، بلوك شاين، بلوك تشاين). Other translators tried to translate the word by searching for an Arabic equivalent. The most common translation today is (سلسلة الكتل), which translates back to English as ‘A Chain of Blocks’, more of an explanation than a translation.

But why is translating to Arabic this tricky? One way to approach this question is by comparing Arabic to Latin. At its peak, Latin was spoken to one extent or another across all of Europe, and the different European peoples started producing their local iterations from Latin, which developed with time to constitute new branched languages.

While Arabic went through a similar phase of popularity, political and cultural reasons dictated that Arabic shall remain one language with multiple dialects, and that these dialects shall not grow into new different languages. Today, one can argue that Moroccan Arabic and Saudi Arabic for instance are less intelligible than Italian and Spanish, however Moroccan and Saudi Arabic are treated as two dialects of the same language, while Italian and Spanish are considered to be two languages.

This is one major source of headache when it comes to translating to Arabic. We need to find a translation that works with people of different linguistic practices, a task that feels like coming up with a ‘European’ translation of the word Blockchain, one that works across the whole of Europe.

The lack of a unified reference for translating blockchain to Arabic has been causing a myriad of issues. On one hand, it created a linguistic bottleneck, keeping most of quality blockchain content away from mono-lingual Arabs. On the other hand, without a standardized way to spell or translate essential keywords, SEO efforts targeting Arab readers will be significantly compromised.

The cost of translating blockchain content to Arabic remains high, as businesses end up developing their own glossaries throughout the translation process, which was the case with both the Ethereum Foundation and Binance. These de facto glossaries, while filling a gap, can in fact, and unintentionally, amplify the problem by introducing translation dispersion, where one term has two translations in two different glossaries, and translation biases, such as regional bias, where a translation is better understood in one part of the Arab region over the rest.

Translation difficulties tend to lead to deeper issues, such as lack of proper blockchain literacy, both on technical and general levels, which allows for more misinformation and stigma around the technology and its uses. That’s why it’s no wonder that MENA (Middle East & North Africa), a region that houses over 570M residents, remains one of the slowest regions in terms of blockchain and crypto currencies adoption in the world.

Too many Uniswap V3 Liquidity Providers lose money. Approximately 40-45 percent of the positions are out of range, resulting in no fee generation. Moreover, Uniswap still lacks the capabilities necessary to rebalance or restructure positions for many possible usages.
These are critical factors to consider, but LPs frequently forget about them, incurring in more risks.

We feel that the ecosystem lacks the tools necessary to properly analyze and address these challenges, making concentrated liquidity a complex activity that does not fully realize and express its potential.

Orbit enables to quickly deploy, automate, combine and monitor structured strategies with total flexibility, abstracting away any operational complexity for any token pair and ranges.

It is an automation layer that allows users to easily define and execute liquidity operations across several protocols.

Our mission is to become the go-to platform for concentrated liquidity, giving users the possibility to deploy and automate complex strategies for managing liquidity, both in and out of range, with the aim of solving all the aforementioned problems.

Orbit works with a Smart Vault model: users own a smart contract that is used as an account to handle tokens, that can then be connected to other protocols to allow for automatic allocations.

It is centered around three main features:
Autocompound: this feature allows the user to automatically swap and reinvest fees sitting idle in the Uni v3 position, maximizing the APY on the idle fraction of the different users’ positions;
Autorebalance: this feature allows the user to put an out-of-range position back into the range so that it is possible to never stop earning fees;
Idle Liquidity: this feature allows users to boost yields by exploiting idle liquidity in other protocols (such as Aave).

These first features can be used on an unlimited number of positions and token pairs at once.

With this Grant we will accelerate development and integration with more and more protocols, in order to give further flexibility to users and enable them to create delta-neutral strategies and hedge against Impermanent Loss.

This system can be forked by any DAO and used in their discord to help determine who is reputable in what area within it.

Why?

How are actions legitimized? This question lies at the core of governance. Within the DAO space, and in democracies at large, this question is usually addressed with voting – quadratically weighted or not.

However, in our extremely technical world, our ability to exercise good judgment about a specific topic vastly differs between us.

Reputation can be thought of as the collective judgment about a certain person or organization’s ability or trustworthiness on a certain topic within a certain context. Thus, reputation systems could aid legitimation processes by offering a supplement to voting-based mechanisms. Indeed, the legitimation process underpinning peer-review is to a large extent reputation-based. Papers with lots of citations become reputable, and that paper’s successive citings are thus granted further legitimacy. One could imagine what the world of science would look like if the legitimacy of papers was entirely the subject of a permissionless vote.

However, the current paradigm of online reputation systems are almost exclusively built on scalars. This is problematic, as much is lost when our multifaceted skills, abilities and relationships are collapsed into uni-dimensional social credit scores.

Multi-dimensional reputation systems offer an alternative. With language models, we have the ability to create such systems from textual interactions that capture the nuance list in scalars, and thus help us determine trustworthiness and legitimacy contextually within a social group.

How?
 
Replabs is building tools for DAOs and communities on Twitter that can be used to determine contextual reputation.
 
Replabs is also doing qualitative research on how well these tools and algorithms match the subjective experiences of the participants within the communities. These qualitative findings will be summarized in a technical paper.

Non-Fungible Castle (NFC) 2021 was a community building event hosted at the Lobkowicz Palace in Prague Castle that bridged the traditional art world with the Web3 community to see how they can enhance, engage, and challenge one another. The event included an international conference exploring how blockchain technology can be incorporated into cultural heritage practices and a free temporary NFT exhibition hosted in one of the most visited cultural landmarks in the Czech Republic featuring original NFTs created by House of Lobkowicz as well as by contemporary artists. The exhibition demonstrated how technology can be used not only to enhance the viewer’s experience with art, but also to see elements that are not visible in the real world. 

The success of NFC, which was also featured on the Unchained Podcast, demonstrates a use case for cultural institutions to increase accessibility, deepen relationships with a broader community of patrons and creators, and establish a creative platform to raise restoration funds. The exhibition received hundreds of visitors daily and the event welcomed over 200 attendees from all over the world. To that end, NFC returns for its second edition. 


Non-Fungible Castle (NFC) 2022 
This year’s event explores how blockchain technology can be used to rediscover, share, and preserve cultural identity. Along with the NFT exhibition and international conference, a large component of this year's NFC will include an interactive cultural program inviting participants to immerse themselves in culture and history while exploring new applications of blockchain technology in the real world. We wish to enrich this experience with additional funding that will allow us to apply different tools that increase accessibility of NFTs and Web3 (for example creating wallets for event attendees), while continuing to pioneer, demonstrate, and educate audiences about the many use cases of blockchain technology. 

Conference
The conference will offer a dynamic forum convening thought leaders and tastemakers to discuss how the art and crypto worlds can engage with one another to shape the future of blockchain technology and cultural preservation. Leading experts in Web3 and the art world will explore a variety of topics and questions, including investing and building in the Web3 space, curation and sales in the Metaverse, and legal and regulatory implications. Our goal is to facilitate a broader conversation around blockchain technology and its applications in the art and philanthropic worlds.

Exhibition
The exhibition is inspired by the remarkable story of world-renowned Czech composer, Antonín Dvořák, who demonstrated an exceptional ability to distill the identity of a culture to a singular work of art. Using Dvořák as a guiding force to create, international artists are invited to meditate on their personal cultural identities through different forms of artistic expression. The aim is not only to educate audiences about the significance of Dvořák, but also celebrate the cultural stories that define who we are and connect us to one another. The exhibition will also display original NFTs created by House of Lobkowicz. 

Interactive Cultural Experience
The interactive cultural experience will offer a dynamic program inviting visitors back in time to Nelahozeves, the birthplace of Antonín Dvořák. There, they will be immersed in Czech traditions, engage with the sights and sounds that inspired Dvořák’s influential body of work, and reconnect to their cultural roots—all through real world experiences enhanced by blockchain technology. 


Our goal is to facilitate a broader conversation around blockchain technology and its applications in the art and philanthropic worlds. By bringing together experts and visionaries from all sectors, we aim to build a growing community of people who value cultural preservation and the innovative possibilities of blockchain technology to make a positive impact in the world. We hope our efforts will help people see the value of blockchain technology beyond JPEGs, asset ownership, or serving as a basis for speculation.

Time is our most precious resource, yet the tools to manage it are still frustratingly ill-suited.

The likes of Lettucemeet and Doodle require inputting options, sharing manually, chasing people, then finally scheduling reminders and agreeing on a channel. On the other hand, tools like Google Calendar or Calendly were designed for scheduling groups within the same company, groups that share the same email domain and don’t mind making their calendar visible to one another. These Web2 tools might work when you’re a corporate employee but are of little use when half your team is anons or some of you work across multiple DAOs.

That’s why we’ve been building a scheduling tool that’s open-source and DAO-contributor-centric. In the first iteration, we create a Calendly-like functionality with privacy protection: no need to give anyone your email, just share your wallet and the tool will create a calendar invite for each of you, with no need to exchange personal data.

Recently, we integrated with ENS domains and Lens protocol to make scheduling even easier.

And now, we’re seeking to take scheduling to the next level by enabling the group to find the next available slot, in as few clicks as possible.

As children are still longer out of school, we are witnessing a greater risk that the poorest among them have never returned to school. It has come with intended consequences as so many children are still at home roaming the streets even after school re-opening. We are experiencing increased cases of violence, child labour, child marriage, and mental well-being. Funding for this project will also help us to build classroom and sanitary facilities in various rural communities in Enugu State who have dilapidated classroom blocks. This project will be implemented in partnership with our local nonprofit organizations working in children's education. 


Challenge:

Most of the women and young girls living in Enugu State lack basic skills and education for income generation. Their dependency on handouts from men through transactional sex makes them vulnerable to social abuse, sexual exploitation, unwanted pregnancies, HIV/AIDS infection and domestic violence as they attempt to get their basic needs. This makes their children vulnerable. 


Solution:

When the school closed in March 2022 due to the Covid-19 pandemic, we expected that every child will return back to school but it never happened. 18.5 million, 10.5 million are girls in Nigeria who never returned to school. We need them back to school to learn with others. There are increased cases of violence and child labour as they continue to roam the streets. Together, let us vulnerable children get back their happy lives by helping them access education as well as reduce child violence and labour.\nSelf-sustained children will be an asset to their families and the community. Children being back to school will enhance their career dreams and propel them to take up community and national leadership roles as others. 


What we have achieved as an organization:

Since its inception in 2016, Helpers Social Development Foundation has been working to implement problems that may prevent children from gaining access to education. We have impacted over 3700 lives through the support of our donors and volunteers. We have built sanitary facilities and distributed free school supplies in public schools to ensure underprivileged children stay in school. October 20221, we established a nursery and primary school in Oji-River due to the growing number of out-of-school children in Nigeria. Our school Helpers Foundation nursery and primary school Oji-river offer 100% free education to out-of-school children. \n\nSupporting our mission will help us to build classroom blocks and distribute free school supplies in public schools to ensure underprivileged children stay in school. 

100% of your donations to our organization go to charity.

In order to constantly catch up with the market and better make their own ENS transaction decisions, name holders have growing demand to have a clear idea of the changeable ENS market sales performance. 
However, since it is still a new market, the sales information is still scattered around all kinds of platforms including social media like Twitter and marketplace like the Opensea. 

Therefore, in order to have a clear idea of the market performance,  users have to spend a lot of effort and time to go through different information channels to gather the scattered sales information, which is indeed hard and very inconvenient for them

What we do
Our website is a platform showing aggregated and in-depth sales information of ENS domains by extracting all the sales records from Opensea, Looksrare and other ENS marketplaces. 



It shows the overall sales data including sales volume, sales ranking, average sold price, floor & highest price of different clubs (e.g. 999 club, 3letters club) within different periods of time. What’s more, we provide a convenient filter function for users to easily find the exact sales information they want. Here, users can filter sales information by different time period, different clubs, different name categories(e.g. Repeat 2, descend 3) . 

Moreover, we visualized the sales volume and sales price into a dynamic chart. Users can easily find  the price change and volume change by day of the specific types of names they select (e.g. Repeat 2 for 999 club in last 30d).  By using this functions, users can easily follow up on the ENS market trend.

Besides that, we also provide all detailed records of each ENS name’s sales.  Users can also rank the sales records by date/ sold price/first digit. 


Our value for ENS
We focus on accomplishing the following for ENS:

Usability - improving the user experience
Instead of spending a lot of effort to go through different platforms to gather the scattered sales information, users can conveniently have a comprehensive view of the ENS transaction market by using our website. Also they can easily find the exact information they want using our filter function. 

Community - growing the ecosystem
We see that the market is rapidly growing and it is really hard for every active user in the community to constantly catch up with the market. WIth that idea, we want to be their support. By tracking all the transaction data in the ENS market and providing up-to-date insights, we hope we can let more community members easily understand the changeable market and let other newcomers see how promising the market is. Moreover, we believe our data can be a kind of tool for a lot of other brilliant community members to use to build up other powerful things. In the end, we can together help grow the ecosystem.

Education - Generating & Promoting content and educational resources about ENS 
Although more and more people are joining the ENS market, most of them still don’t have a thorough idea about the ENS market insights. Our website wants to educate users to become more expert in the market. Here, they can learn how to better use the data to discover insights of the market. For example, from the price chartthey can see when the price goes up and down and know when the market is prosperous and when to buy/sell their own name property.

Future Development Plan 
With the grant, we want to develop our website into a more powerful market analysis platform. Two more functions are under development:
(1) More visualization：
Apart from the price chart, we are also considering to develop more visualization tools including sales volume chart, floor price chart and etc. We believe with more powerful visualization functions, users will find it more convenient to cultivate insights of the market. 
(2) Intelligent future forecast: 
Besides past sales data analysis, we also want to include future forecast function into our website. By analysing the past data, we can forecast future average sold price and volume of the ENS market. We believe this function will help more users master the ENS market.

7646,Sugoi Protocol: Web3’s first Green Savings Protocol,0,0xDEdbc83667A22f95a56398956285b823DCE0b126,"Hii Gitcoiners! We are Sugoi protocol 🌱

Who?

Sugoi is web3’s first green savings protocol where users can deposit their stablecoins, earn interest, and be able to redirect a percentage of that interest towards environmental NGOs. Users are incentivized by social impact, tax deductions and special rewards like NFTs.

What?

We call Sugoi a green savings protocol because as you earn yield on your savings you also create impact for environmental causes hence our motto “park2impact”.

How?

Sugoi is a fully decentralized protocol that generates yield on users' deposits by depositing into decentralized lending protocols i.e. Aave and then automatically donating the yield while giving users access to their deposit with earned yield anytime. We also plant a tree for every time user makes a deposit to Sugoi ☘️.

In future, Sugoi will have an SDK to enable other web3 protocols to add green savings feature to their product.

Why?

Today, there are a lot of stable coins in digital wallets today doing nothing. 
When we deposit money in a traditional bank that money is put to use by lending it out and earning yield for the bank. Sugoi was born while brainstorming how we can in fact — “park2impact” putting your stable coins to use.

Our core thesis is that there is a wide market of individuals who own stable coins but don’t know how to put them to use. Sugoi gives users the ability to both earn yield and create impact in a way no other crypto native solution has attempted.

After doing some research we found most individuals who own crypto have yet to use Decentralized Finance in any way, shape or form. We believe a few factors contributing to this would be the learning curve and onboarding hurdles. At Sugoi we are building an intuitive protocol with easy-to-use UI and docs that will enable smooth onboarding process to DeFi for the average native and non-native crypto user.

Team?

We are a team of three reimagining web3 for social impact with Shraddha leading, Mateo building, and Luciano expanding the Sugoi protocol. 

We’d be so grateful for your support in GR15 as we build web3 first must-have green savings protocol. 

Thank you!

With love,

oscillo is a P2P Matchmaking Protocol that puts price over everything. We aim to create a profitable trading environment that is friendly to crypto traders all around the world. In such a rapid and ever changing market, we want to become a place where all crypto traders can feel a sense of guarantee and safety. Now oscillo prioritizes value over time. We believe that it is important to put users’ funds before the time it takes to complete an order. Our matchmaking system highlights this belief. We also believe that eventually, the two aspects will balance out, because as more users are drawn in because of the value of our transactions, they will begin to take less time. 

What makes oscillo unique
Index Price: Off-chain pricing system that uses the average price of various trusted markets.
Index-Limit Order: Only executed at index price when the index price satisfies or is more profitable than the trigger conditions.
Hybrid On/Off chain: Off-chain pricing for slippage or MEV protection and on-chain settlement for reliable transaction.
Trading Widget: oscillo’s trading widget can support P2E games’ in game auctions. The projects can charge a trading fee if they wish to do so. This means that projects can concentrate solely on game development instead.

What’s the oscillo’s benefit for traders
Guaranteed Price: Trade any volume of tokens without losing money on price impact, slippage or MEV attacks.
Free Trading: oscillo currently offers a zero trading fee promotion for all trading pairs to celebrate our launch.
Gasless(meta): The only thing you need to start trading is a gasless signature.
Growth Market: Market friendly to new tokens with liquidity providing issues. More profitable trades for users trading these tokens as there is significantly less slippage.

Roadmap
We think these items are needed to trade reasonably in Defi. We will choose the top priority according to the traders’ voices.

The Bonsai Template - Notion Documentation (This file is the index, or the Bible for all things Bonsai.so that are in production.)

Bonsai is Patreon for Web3– a walled garden for your community to access exclusive content, perks, and events.

Bonsai is web2/web3 hybrid. Beginners can use Stripe, and pros can use Unlock Protocol (NFT utilities with their cryptocurrency of choice), to purchase their memberships.

Category: Web3, Community, Continuing Education, Developer Tools, K-12, Entertainment, and Media.

The Problem: Centralized Closed Platforms
Whether it’s Patreon, OnlyFans, Teachable, Shopify, etc– they own your content, your audience, your business, and so they basically own you.

The Solution: Decentralized Open Source Platforms
In the future, you will have a convenient open-source option. You will have the option of owning the software that you and your community use. You will own all of the rights to make the decision whether you want to run it on your own server, or pay somebody else to manage it for you. Either way, you own the full code repository and the database. You will own your business, and community– or it will be community owned.

Funding:
Funding will be used to get to Beta version, as well as fund Bonsai's grant program which will develop features such Masterclass (LMS), Shopify (e-commerce), Substack, and a metaverse university for web3. I will keep my focus on the core of the product (Patreon) until eligible grantees apply.

Roadmap:
Bonsai is currently in pre-beta. Here are some things we'd like to accomplish before beta:
Revenue splitting (gated access and streaming payments already accomplished with Unlock Protocol and Stripe)
Launch starter plan for $50/m
Update Bonsai courses (involves shooting and editing updated tutorials)
Front-end Editing and Customizing (using ACF)
Events (as a custom post type)
Launch Bonsai Grants (Shopify, Masterclass, Substack, and metaverse university for web3)
After Beta:
iOS app (shared content using WP-API)
Widgets for daily check-ins from community (similar to BeReal or Insight Timer)

Team (Board Members of DAO):
Chris Do
Julien Genestoux
Currently inviting: Tim Ferriss and Jonathan Courtney


Competition and Key Differentiators:
Unlike Patreon, Bonsai is Open Source and web3 ready out of the box.
Unlike Creaton, Bonsai is web2/web3 hybrid. It gives you the option to pay in cash or other trades of value. The type of content and perks you can offer is more flexible, including selling physical products. Also, Creaton isn't very active on Github, despite taking at $1.1M in funding.",Valid Ethereum Address. 
7652,Portals & Passages: magical gates as 'web3 hyperlinks' between on-chain worlds (like Realms and Crypts & Caverns) to enable meta quests and games,0,0x48b799AC8F5b71024Fb26D59E8CBE68CDc734721,"Portals & Passages is a CC0, fully on-chain NFT collection of 1000 magical gates, called 'Portals'.


Backstory:
Genesis Era: The Ancient Schools of Enchantment competed to build magical Portals & Passages scattered across the Lootverse, and powered by rare Enchantment Gems;
Age of Exploration: Adventurers traveled the world from Realm to Realm, to Dungeons, to Wonders, through Enchanted Portals & Passages managed by the Guild of Navigators.
The Mist: Portals were abandoned, their locations forgotten. But fragments about their existence survived in tales of the past.
Age of Adventure: The Council of the 16 Orders and the Guild of Navigators tasked scholars from all Orders to locate and revive the Enchanted Portals & Passages. One by one Portals are being unearthed. Soon, Adventurers will voyage through, reaching faraway Dungeons, entering foreign Order lands, bowing down before Wonders, going back in Time…


It draws from deep loot lore:


Portals & Passages is built with a CC0, composability, building block mindset, and aim to offer new possibilities for builders and writers to include movement of Characters across Places and Eras in their projects.

The Portals mapping (e.g. each Portal's location) will be generated by users, during the portals rediscovery (e.g. mint). Compatible ecosystems where users can define a location for their portals will be Realms and Crypts & Caverns to start with, and the contract will make it possible to add other ones over time. It will be possible for a given Portal to have a location in each compatible ecosystem, in the sense that a Portal magically coexists in different worlds, thus connecting them together.

Portals could be seen as 'web3 hyperlinks'. Indeed they create connections both:
between places in different on-chain worlds, through the coexistence of a given portal in different worlds;
between places in a given on-chain ecosystem like Crypts & Caverns dungeons, by enabling all kind of builders creativity ideas on how to link 2 portals located in 2 different dungeons together.

Portals come with on-chain SVG visual. We introduce an innovation on that front, by enabling multiple different SVG renderers, that users can choose from for their own Portals. We'll start with 2 original renderers (e.g. 'Loot OG' and 'Portals OG atmosphere') and it will be possible to add more over time (incl. renderers submitted by 3rd parties, like partner projects). Users can pass a byte array of customisation params that renderers can interpret (for example for letting users customise the background color). So for example referenced ecosystems where users can locate their Portals projects could also optionally develop and submit a Portals SVG renderer in cohesion with the atmosphere of their project (added to the list holders can choose from).",Valid Ethereum Address.

🌱 LunkLabs helps regenerative stewards and practicioners access legitimate certification tailored to their unique regenerative praxis, by codifying their practices into eco-credits/credit classes and documenting them on-chain 🌻.`#NotAVentureStudio`

How?
🍄 We convene and facilitate collaboration between scientific experts and regenerative projects and practitioners 🌕.

Use Case:
Imagine a coffee grower in Mexico who practices agroforestry to grow their crops (because it's a pragmatic and generative way for them to work). In order to make ends meet they band together with other farmers and pool their resources as part of a cooperative. Even though the co-op gives them a degree of scale to leverage, the affordance of certifications like ""organic"" are too expensive or cumbersome to administrate (because of the plurality of practitioners and plots that would each need to get certified). They are barred at the institutional gates. However these days we can do better! 

Enter LunarPunk_Labs as digital intermediary. 

We work with smallholders and their representatives to enable them to reach their highest common potential in aggregate. In this case we're talking about agroforestry; so we facilitate workshops to learn about and determine the regenerative functions of their ecosystem (e.g. metrics such as tree diversity on-farm, nearby forest density etc.). We then construct concept notes with the functional requirements for translating their practice-based methodology into credits, credit classes and 'ecological state protocols'. Our assumptions are then checked with our expert advisors and consultants to avoid unintended consequences. Once credits are issued and the protocol goes to market, the co-ops and their members have a new form of revenue. 

More specifically:
The wider field of action at play here is the reconciliation of active inference with distributed monitoring, verification and reporting. These instruments are used to convert bottom up practice-based methodologies into hardened concept notes and functional requirements for specifying open-source ecological state protocols. These concept notes are licenced under creative commons, and the protocols will then be deployed on open-source networks (e.g. Regen Registry, Celo, etc.).

The significance of this undertaking means that in order to be viable, vital and evolutionary, we'll need to operationalise across several domains of activity at once. Consequently we see our use of funds needing to be distributed across the following organisational ecology: 

Use of funds:
- Research
- Design 
- Development 
- Marketing 
- Education 

Why?
🔒 Bypassing gatekeepers to generate equity 🔑

Gatekeepers are frustrating because they hold back scientific progress and legitimate regenerative practices with their myopic demands for legibility. We want to help the long tail bypass them in order to onboard a cosmos of eco-credits and other forms of indescribable value that will increase the well-being of life on earth. 

> We are facilitating the development of ecological state protocols that serve people and planet by harnessing markets, science and technology.

For whom?
🧞‍♂️ The long tail of small-hold farmers; our key metric is a gini coefficient 🧞‍♀️

Regenerative transformation will be driven by the long tail; not the instutitions of academia, government nor big industry. Our energy is best spent there. We serve enviromental stewards and the regenerative technology community at large.

Beyond this we are aware that disruptive technology brings unintended consequences. JEDIs represent justice, equity, diversity and inclusion in their process design (). 

Consequentially we act as a digital intermediary that helps level the playing field for local earth stewards and their representatives who wish to interact with a rising tide of 'network states' and 'digital republics' (ideally the latter). We do this by facilitating semantic workshops with a transparent (and thus debatable) epistemology.

TreeHouseDAO is a brand new web3 co-creative publishing house for public goods information that serves people and planet. 

Our first project has been co-creating an open-source handbook for aspiring regenerative village builders. This handbook is already becoming an actionable blueprint which enables, guides and assists aspiring builders to start, design, govern and incorporate their own regenerative villages. This is based on feedback from the re:build community (an organisation supporting localised events for village builders) stating a strong communal need for support.

Why do we need Tree House DAO?
There is no other web3 publishing organisation that focuses on regenerating the planet.

Why do we need a regenerative village builders handbook?
Especially since lockdown, many people have realised there might be a better alternative to being packed in concrete boxes, stacked on top of each other in increasingly hot cities that rely on fragile supply chains. Those of us looking for other ways of being want to live in regenerative villages that gives us a sense of true belonging, a connection to nature, to each other, and a sense of personal and collective purpose. But the process can seem daunting and complex, this means that many people get stuck in analysis paralysis and struggle to progress; therefore there is a need for a simple guide created by those who have already walked the path of regenerative living.

It is a complex, fast paced, ever changing landscape as more and more alternative ways of living and being are being experimented on. This means that a lot of progress and experience is happening constantly. Instead of re-inventing the wheel, there is a need for alignment of patterns, processes, successes and failures. With more and more fully functioning prototype villages, this means that there is plenty of real world experience to draw from.
 
How is the book writing being kicked-off?
Hosted as part of the re:build events series, and during a two week long Village Builders' Mastermind workshop at the Traditional Dream Factory (TDF) - a prototype village of Oasa Network - a group of 22 established regenerative village builders from around the world has convened to share knowledge & experience in order to co-create the open source Regenerative Village Builders' Handbook for aspiring regenerative village builders. 




What does TreeHouseDAO do to make a book?
Assisted by the in-house TreeHouseDAO team of designers, writers, creatives who distil and visualise knowledge and the vast amounts of information generated we have a first draft of the book, the mastermind takes the participants on a fun, engaging journey of content creation to bring the book to life. Using a unique TreeHouseDAO created methodology we are able to co-create an entire book of 200 pages in just 10 days. Culminating in an open day where 15 more people from our extended community can come and critique the book and help finesse its content. We intend on repeating this process for all other organisations who wish to publish an open source book on any topic that helps regenerate the planet and its people.

Forta is a decentralized monitoring network to detect threats and anomalies on DeFi, NFT, governance, bridges and other Web3 systems in real-time.
Underlying Forta is a decentralized network of independent node operators that scan all transactions and block-by-block state changes for outlier transactions and threats. When an issue is detected, node operators send alerts to subscribers of potential risks, which enables them to take action.

## What is this agent
After the sanction of Tornado Cash, many attackers move to other services to launder their money. Umbra Protocol is a stealth address protocol for Ethereum, meaning it allows a payer to send funds to a fresh address, which is controlled by the intended receiver, but only the payer and the receiver know that. Although technically speaking Umbra Protocol is not a mixer, its privacy protection feature makes it seem to be an alternative to Tornado Cash. Consequently, this agent will be built to monitor transfers related to Umbra Protocol, and hopefully, we can link the sender and receiver accurately based on its working principle.",Valid Ethereum Address. 
7660,Plastic Labs - Toward a Hyperstructure for Learning,0,0x4066255cd05e75f597A4C244DDcE18880a600ef2,"Innovation in the way we learn is long overdue. Classrooms, grading systems, and similar structures were designed for the height of educational centralization and are heavily outdated. Blockchains are paving the way for decentralized peer-to-peer networks with programmable incentive mechanisms to emerge and create self-sustaining economic subsystems. Thus, it should be possible for us to experiment with cutting-edge learning techniques, incentives, and designs. Yet hardly any tooling is available to support that kind of experimentation. 

We’re here to change that.

Educational tooling needs a structure of structures — a hyperstructure — crypto protocols that can run for free and forever, without maintenance, interruption or intermediaries. Good education evolves, good minds evolve, tools improve, so the tenets of hyperstructure enable an open protocol where a massive diversity of approaches can exist on a unified data layer and hopefully birth an explosion in interoperable learning innovation, the community-driven creation of universal education, the meta public good.

To simultaneously meet the ever-growing need for education in the web3 community and beyond and to iterate on learning experiences in a manner that will allow the right primitives for hyperstructure to emerge, our inaugural experiment will leverage community expertise and pedagogical knowhow to rapidly create robust learning experiences on important emerging topics. These learning experiences will be offered to the community for open-source consumption, but if learners prefer a peer-to-peer learning experience, we will also offer cohort-based courses as rapidly as the content is curated. These guerilla style CBCs will surface the primitives that should be incorporated into a hyperstructure, scaled, and ultimately computed over and optimized.

In this mission, a Gitcoin grant serves two purposes:

1. To fund the contributors who are developing curricula for the CBCs
2. To fund developers working on the emergent primitive infrastructure we derive as a result of our learnings from the CBCs

Whether your lens falls on the developing metacrisis and humanity's clear failure to coordinate at the scale necessary to secure a longterm safe future, the rising costs and sinking outcomes of traditional education, the political divisions that cause and are caused by that failure in the status quo, the growth of misinformation and censorship targeting those least likely to survive them, the current erosion of professional opportunity for our most talented educators, or all of the above—the need for change, for conscious optimism, and for tinkering in our educational systems could not be more clear, or more urgent.

Menthol Protocol strives to make regeneration more accessible, affordable and integrated seamlessly into our everyday actions. The goal is to empower climate leaders and decentralized communities to drive the transformation towards regenerative growth with our PERMISSIONLESS climate-action tool.

Menthol Protocol is a web3 protocol with a foundation in place paving the way for our Menthol DAO which offers climate-positivity-as-a-service, including the entire end-to-end-process of calculating non-avoidable emissions, curating high-impact tokens, and purchasing these respectively in real-time. Tokenizers of environmental impact tokens love working with us, as we create a continuous business model between them and their customers. The first set of environmental impact tokens are CO2e and renewable energy credits.




Our mission is to live decentralization, but with regeneration first. Hereby, our first aim is nothing less than to turn the entire web3 space climate-positive, across all L1, L2s, dApps, communities, and individual wallet users. Forever. With just a few clicks. No-code integration allows for high interoperability across chains. 


 


After fine-tuning this solution to decarbonizing web3, we want to offer the same service to any individual, community, or organization in the non-web3 world (web2). The first step towards climate change is reducing the individual carbon footprint through changes in behavior, new processes, and innovation. The second very important step to combat climate crises is calculating your non-avoidable emissions and over-compensating for them through for instance the mechanisms of the carbon offsetting market. Menthol Protocol automates this second step and brings climate positivity to anyone unleashing all ReFi projects. There is no excuse for turning climate positive, never has it been easier. 

We strongly believe that we can build a leading climate-tech DAO amplifying existing ReFi ecosystems and building jointly towards a regenerative tomorrow with a self-motivating community capable of cooling the world with our tech.



We are 100% directing the requested funds from this grant to the offsetting efforts of web3, starting with projects mainly on Ethereum and Polygon. It will be used to develop incentives and awareness programs for projects and individuals to understand what CO2e impacts are and how to offset their carbon footprint in the web3 world.




Menthol Protocol is building a public good to allow eventually any individual, organization, and community on planet Earth to offset their respective carbon footprint in a transparent, automated, secure, and verifiably impactful manner. Menthol Protocol is also then expanding into other impact tokens (starting with environmental).

We will be working on developing unique carbon footprint calculation metrics and methodologies for blockchain networks (web3) and the energy sector (web2). Our carbon footprint calculator will be open source and will be improved parallel to the scientific-based research, also published. There are many scientific metrics and methodologies for off-chain carbon footprint calculation, especially in the aviation, chemicals, and oil & gas industries. However, the web3 and non-web3 ecosystem is developing every other day as well as the methodologies to calculate non-avoidable emissions. 





We are a 20-person strong team, and growing, from all over the world covering every continent, and are ready to turn climate crises into climate action, serving, in particular, the ReFi web3 actors as an intelligent middleware. We have specialists on board and will further produce sound scientific literature and analysis not only on the calculation side but even more importantly on the supply side of high-quality impact tokens, starting with CO2e credits and renewable energy tokens.

7663,Cryptomurals - Street art as public good,0,0xe4458d575e5D6867e6A9e52dED44cef8c0F888F8,"Cryptomurals is a blockchain-based platform focused on promoting and preserving the best street art worldwide, making it accessible as a public good.

Our mission is to preserve the cultural heritage with interactive web3 dApps and bring artists and active citizens together to build inclusive environments in public spaces.

The project was an EthGlobal finalist at the Web3Jam Hackathon in November 2021.

 1. Cryptomurals

Cryptomurals aims to be a living archive in the Ethereum blockchain that allows navigating the history of all the layers of murals painted over the years on the same wall - we call it ""The Wallchain"". 

Cryptomurals public gallery will be the digital home to curated geolocated murals, with a dynamic map that allows exploring cities in gamified street-art huntings.

 2. Collaborative experiences

We believe that art is for everyone. Cryptomurals run local initiatives to support artists to create murals and tokenize their artworks in cities around ETH community events. 

A geolocation-based scan system will allow participants to claim new murals and unlock exclusive content such as animations, AR experiences, or NFTs.  

 3. Street-art hunters community

Our platform will allow a collaborative process where individuals provide insights on the state of the artworks by city, securing the preservation of the heritage and keeping the archives updated. 

The community will collaborate asynchronously in challenges around inclusion, culture promotion, and web3 adoption initiatives to fund street art as a public good while playing around.

It's a tool that can be used by anyone who wants to make their city a more beautiful place.

 4. The future of Cryptomurals

Cities and art festivals can integrate Cryptomurals as the leading platform to archive the cultural heritage of the murals in their location. We want to make it easy for anyone to use web3 tools to share their local murals with others worldwide. 

Insights in the Cryptomurals platform will nurture the community's collective intelligence and the decision-making around local-run initiatives. Opportunities can include quadratic voting to promote new murals geolocations or support the renovation of existing spots.

We are a group of street artists and tech enthusiasts from Latin America who believe in inclusion thanks to art workshops and renovation of public spaces such as basketball yards, Sk8 parks, etc. 

We believe in street art as a public good.

 5. Contributions

We're thrilled to share that we're making progress with our mission. 

Along with the ETH Colombia community, we are building Cryptomurals graffiti tours to propose a street art hunting experience for Devcon6 visitors. Participants will discover Bogotá and unlock exclusive content in our genesis. The experience will be organized by Cryptomurals and developed by Doingud. 

We're excited to continue on this journey with the progressive support of our community, and we hope you will join us in our quest to extend the values of decentralization to fund public goods.

However, due to the current situation of the advertising duopoly (Google Ads and Facebook Ads), the challenge of user privacy is gradually emerging.

Privacy laws are being tightened globally, but Google and Facebook are still in violation of GDPR. Users are forced to watch endless ads, risking privacy breaches, yet advertising fees are earned by the advertising platforms.

AdMeta solves this problem by giving the ownership of user privacy back to the users.

With zero-knowledge proof, users are able to control and use their private data for advertising matchings, without exposing the data itself. By doing this, users are directly rewarded by advertisers.

We also introduce DID (decentralized identity) and SBT(Soulbound Token) to our platform, to enrich users' data for the best advertising services. Also, our audience segmentation is tailored for Web3.

We start this project on September 2021, and now we've already built an MVP including WebApp and our Blockchain Testnet. We are currently building our extension and SDK, to allow advertisers and users to access our network easily.

We’ve created a new alternative source of liquidity by concentrating liquidity of large orders in one place and becoming the platform for OTC in crypto.

Mission:

We envision MarsBase as a perfect solution for organizing and forming the secondary OTC market for retail that allows both whales and relates to co-exist and concentrate the liquidity in one place.

Our primary goal is the creation of a marketplace with coins of medium and low capitalization. The number of available assets will exceed 1000 different blockchain tokens. We estimate that all transactions greater than $50k which are not suitable for large OTC desks will be traded on MarsBase. This way, in 3 years, we are going to take 10% of the trading volume with transactions of up to $50k and a potential income of $1.6 billion.

This will allow MarsBase to become the largest decentralized OTC cross-chain ecosystem in DeFi and stabilize the market, making it less risky and more profitable.
The MarsBase platform consists of several modules with unique features.


The Problems MarsBase solves:

Due to the fragmentation of the existing DeFi market and the absence of the infrastructure which can gather the liquidity for high-volume deals of retail investors altogether, the following problems are arising:

-Large market caps don’t mean deep order books, the OTC market exists for top 10 cryptos and is gated-access.
-For many tokens with large market caps there is no liquidity and no repo possibilities for large buyers/sellers.
-Niche of unvested tokens and equity remains untapped.
-No one place aggregates OTC trading.

What we hope to achieve
With DeSci exploding in popularity, tech and usecases, we expect the desire for individuals to receive direct funding for their research objectives to grow exponentially. DeSciWorld is dedicated to providing an infrastructure to support this growth in citizen science, independent from traditional institutional funding requirements. Reduction or removal of the gatekeeping present throughout research and academia is our goal; DeSciWorld is making it clear: science is a public good. 

About the P2P Research Funding Platform
Winner of the first place prize at ETHSeoul for the Filecoin/IPFS tract, the P2P Research Funding platform is a simple yet effective piece of blockchain infrastructure that connects researchers and funders in a permissionless and peer-to-peer manner. 

Researchers looking for funding can create a proposal describe their research goals and funding requirements and vye for the attention of benevolent funders. Likewise, funders with a desire to commission a research goal can place a bounty on a subject and accept bids from researchers anywhere in the world to carry out their request. Building this platform on the blockchain allows decentralised and trustless handling of funds and data. 

Featuring: a smart contract Escrow system that unlocks funding at predefined milestones; decentralised ID (DID) with various tiers of anonymity to accommodate any preference; automated commits of data submissions to IPFS and an independent Review Committee, the P2P Research Funding platform is designed to facilitate a renaissance of citizen science.

About DeSciWorld
DeSciWorld is a community-driven initiative aiming to facilitate the on-boarding of people into the decentralized science (DeSci) space. By providing a suite of products and services that engage and empower would be DeScientists, we will support a second renaissance of science that is inclusive to all, including those peoples and ideas previously left “on the outside” due to economic, social or cultural barriers within academia.

Learn more about this radically open experiment here. This project is being championed by Carbonbase because of their exemplary impact.

How does it work?

In the Brazilian Amazon, forest land that is not used for ""productive activities"" can be claimed by the government then turned into cattle ranches or exploited by illegal loggers. Revenue from this offset project helps local villagers to acquire legal land ownership rights of their ancestral home and protect it from being taken over by the cattle and logging industry. It will also pay for agroforestry training workshops so that the locals can improve their livelihoods (i.e. by planting sustainable cacao trees) while protecting the rainforest. The covered area protects over 400 families from being displaced and empowers them to protect the forests.

Why did we choose this project?

The Amazon Rainforest is one of the most precious and diverse natural resources on the planet, but also one of the most vulnerable to disappear for commercial purposes. The location of the project makes it an ideal area to be protected, standing at the edge of the deforestation frontier: about 95 percent of all deforestation occurs within 50 kilometers of highways or roads. The government plans a highway to go through the project area - this project is the last defense to prevent destruction. The project builds up the local community's capacity to monitor and evacuate loggers. The project is part of the award-winning sustainability programs of Allcot, with more than 10 years of experience in forestry project management and training that help deliver sustainable development to the local communities served.

What is the impact of additional funding?

Funding prevents 3,000 hectares from being deforested annually. For every hectare of land (the size of a rugby field) not cut down or used for cattle pasture, there are 500 tons of CO2 stored in trees (above and below ground). This project supports the local population: over 400 families will no longer fear being displaced. By contributing to the project, you empower the local people to protect the forest. The amount of reduction in emissions through avoidance for the entire project is 553,273 tons of CO2 per year. Prevention of net emissions over the project lifetime of 40 years is more than 20 million tons of CO2.

How do we verify the impact?

This project has been independently verified in accordance with the Verified Carbon Standard. You can view at anytime the public project page and offset credit retirement history below. Verra was founded in 2005 by environmental and business leaders who saw the need for greater quality assurance in voluntary carbon markets. Verra serves now as a secretariat for the various standards it develops and programs it manages, as well as having an incubator for new ideas that can generate meaningful environmental and social value at scale.",Valid Ethereum Address.

We at LightItUpDAO intend to become one of the first blockchain enabled production companies. We are building a community for people who are passionate about creating art with light. We want to be together, and we love to display enormous, generous images in outdoor spaces to delight, inform and inspire the public.
In part, our purpose is to raise awareness around causes and groups that need visibility, and we want to partner with organizations to educate the public about the collective, public, or social benefit of the organization. 
We also want to support digital artists by putting their indoor digital art outside on buildings. We want to educate artists about DAOs and Crypto advocacy.
We desire to teach what we have learned to the members of our DAO and other interested parties. We will educate organizations about the DAO and Crypto space and the workings of the ETH network. We will educate our partners and the public about DAO formation and the benefits of DAO governance, and onboard them to Web3.
We are people who want to spend all of our time in Web3. We are passionate about changing the world through this technology, and we can’t help but talk about it all the time.

Mandates
Awareness - build visibility for causes, partner with orgs and artists that want visibility
Onboarding - DAO Community building, Crypto education
Empowerment - learn and teach mechanics of projection art, carry out light actions

Proof of Concept

7625,"Yeet: A community of practice for founders, funders, and builders of agentic technologies",0,0x98030c2E2cF7abC8291E4F3ddedd96856A74EDB1,"Privacy is a public good. Surveillance capitalism results from coordination failures to protect it.

The recent AFAC ruling that outlawed financial privacy in crypto proves this point: we need better coordination mechanisms to protect the technological commons — in our product design, in regulatory policy, and in the public consciousness.

Yeet is on a trifold mission to address this collective action problem by:

Guiding the web3 dialogue toward a consensus around commonly accepted ethical standards and practices for privacy, dignity, and consent in emerging tech
Reduce the coordination costs among founders, investors, and operators who share these goals
Secure an agentic, anti-authoritarian, self-sovereign technological future

Why

It is helpful to think of privacy, consent, and human dignity as a commons — one that needs protection through the collective action of decentralized but highly-coordinated individuals committed to building agentic, ethical technologies. We must collectively exit the game theoretic race to build, ship, and break things faster than the other guy — all the while concentrating the benefits and socializing the costs to secondary users and across generations.

Yeet exists exactly for this reason: to lower the coordination costs among a decentralized network of founders, funders, and operators who all share similar, prosocial technological goals.

How

At Yeet, we interrogate key concepts, organize fireside chats hosted by internal and external thought leaders, encourage the emergence of ethical design consensus, and produce content that distills the insights from our shared learnings for the broader public.

Yeeters are founders, operators, and investors that represent organizations such as Aspen Institute, Aztec, Bluesky, Centre, Disco, Espresso Systems, Ethereum Foundation, Filecoin, Fission, Flashbots, Polygon, iden3, KYCDAO, Nucleo, Privy, Protocol Labs, Soulbound Labs, and many more projects at the frontier of crypto privacy, identity, and sovereignty.

Prior and upcoming firesides have included:

Self-sovereign data rails with Bluesky
Privacy as a commons with Privy
UX design discussion: identity, reputation, and community
Encoding prosocial values in game design with KERNEL
Privacy policy in a post-Tornado Cash world with Electronic Frontier Foundation
MEV and privacy with Flashbots and RookFi

Our key differentiator is our vetted, high-trust, members-only environment, as well as community enforcement of good-faith communication principles. These conditions are necessary to inspire honest dialogue, fervent but respectful disagreement, strong rapport, and reliable coordination among a decentralized network of builders and investors. In turn, these qualities seed the emergence of consensus about baseline standards for agentic technologies that advance rather than deplete human dignity.

What's Next?

What started from a simple Telegram group grew into a high-trust, high-signal discourse club for builders and investors. We convene on Slack, Notion, and Zoom to engage in open dialogue, pressure-test new ideas, develop frameworks of thought, and cultivate consensus around acceptable tech standards, design choices, and social externalities.

Over the past three months since our founding, we identified opportunities to further our mission:

1. Agentic Future Summit

No amount of remote firesides, no matter how engaging the speaker or thrilling the subject matter, can ever replicate the effervescence of in-person interaction.

The success of our mission depends on trust, which is built on strong rapport.
We plan to organize the Agentic Future Summit, a side event at SXSW 2023 to gather the best thinkers and builders committed to securing a dignified human future with technology, including a series of workshops, focused talks, and intimate networking opportunities.

This grant will go towards space rental, catering, marketing, equipment, and people’s time to organize and run it.

Delivery Date: March 10-19 2023 (SXSW 2023)

2. Privacy & Identity Landscape Map

Founders of privacy-preserving protocols and projects that leverage decentralized identity are left on their own to navigate the labyrinthine ecosystem of infrastructure, data rails, DID specifications, encryption methods, and applications on their journey to define a critical path to product market fit. And new ones are emerge almost weekly. 

This chaotic, creative, and hopeful space would benefit from an interactive, searchable, and dynamically updated map of the privacy and identity landscape to encourage greater awareness, coordination, collaboration among builders and funders.

We plan to:

Build a public website providing a taxonomy of projects allowing for hierarchical and categorical filtering and searching, including:
Identification: What the project is
Use cases: What (end-user) problems this project helps solve
Differentiation: How this project differs from others
Technical analysis: Answer questions such as “what user data stays private?” and “what does the user have consent over?”
Provide an interactive graphical representation of the landscape.
Periodically publish Gartner-style updates similar to the Thoughtworks Technology Radar.

Delivery Date: Ongoing

3. Content & Miscellaneous

Almost all of our discourse intentionally remains private, members-only content. This is by design. After all, discretion is what makes Yeet a unique, safe, and honest place to debate, debrief, and disagree.

But once half-formed ideas turn into inspired action, our shareable learnings should see the light of day! We want to allocate funding toward the production of a public podcast as well as articles and social media content.

In addition to developing Yeet’s external voice and presence, grant funding would help offsets costs associated with async collaboration software, web development and hosting, and other internet services.

Team

There are 60 members in the discourse club, which is run by a small, agile team of core contributors who volunteer their time:

Anastasia Uglova (Mirror | LinkedIn | Twitter)
Howard Tam (LinkedIn | Twitter)
Chad Fowler (LinkedIn | Twitter)

Grant funding will empower us to expand and accelerate capacity by compensating members for writing and delivering content, planning in-person events, handling outreach, programming, and scheduling for firesides, maintaining teams bios, contacts, and administrative work, and growing our membership.

More about cryonics research
Human cryonics matters because it has the potential to allow people to be preserved at the cellular level and revived in the future. This could potentially allow humans to be resurrected after death. There are many research breakthroughs that still need to be made.

Cryopreservation, or the process of freezing cells, has been used for years by medical laboratories to preserve animal cells, human embryos, and even some organized tissues. However, it is not currently possible to revive large animals or organs from a frozen state. Large vitrified organs tend to develop fractures during cooling, and without cryoprotectants, cell shrinkage and high salt concentrations during freezing usually prevent frozen cells from functioning again after thawing. Ice crystals can also disrupt connections between cells that are necessary for organs to function.
Cryonicists argue that, as long as brain structure remains intact, it is possible to recover its information content. Cryonics proponents go further than the mainstream consensus in saying that the brain does not have to be continuously active to survive or retain memory. Cryonics controversially states that a human survives even within an inactive brain that has been badly damaged, provided that original encoding of memory and personality can, in theory, be adequately inferred and reconstituted from what structure remains.

Cryonics uses temperatures below −130 °C, called cryopreservation, in an attempt to preserve enough brain information to permit the future revival of the cryopreserved person. Cryopreservation may be accomplished by freezing, freezing with cryoprotectant to reduce ice damage, or by vitrification to avoid ice damage. Even using the best methods, cryopreservation of whole bodies or brains is very damaging and irreversible with current technology.
Cryonics advocates hold that in the future the use of some kind of presently-nonexistent nanotechnology may be able to help bring the dead back to life and treat the diseases which killed them. Mind uploading has also been proposed.

7562,AbjaDAO | Translating Blockchain to Arabic,0,0x776b3b6238CB38b55c7492824318ADAFA1e6fa45,"AbjaDAO | The DAO Translating Blockchain to Arabic

How to translate the word ‘Blockchain’ to Arabic? 13 years after Bitcoin was launched, somehow this question remains unanswered.

Some translators choose to Arabize the term, or type it with Arabic alphabets, so it sounds the same and maintains its global familiarity. But due to Arabic’s phonetic complexity, the word Blockchain can be spelled in either one of eight different ways: (بلوكتشين، بلوكشين، بلوكتشاين، بلوكشاين، بلوك شين، بلوك تشين، بلوك شاين، بلوك تشاين). Other translators tried to translate the word by searching for an Arabic equivalent. The most common translation today is (سلسلة الكتل), which translates back to English as ‘A Chain of Blocks’, more of an explanation than a translation.

But why is translating to Arabic this tricky? One way to approach this question is by comparing Arabic to Latin. At its peak, Latin was spoken to one extent or another across all of Europe, and the different European peoples started producing their local iterations from Latin, which developed with time to constitute new branched languages.

While Arabic went through a similar phase of popularity, political and cultural reasons dictated that Arabic shall remain one language with multiple dialects, and that these dialects shall not grow into new different languages. Today, one can argue that Moroccan Arabic and Saudi Arabic for instance are less intelligible than Italian and Spanish, however Moroccan and Saudi Arabic are treated as two dialects of the same language, while Italian and Spanish are considered to be two languages.

This is one major source of headache when it comes to translating to Arabic. We need to find a translation that works with people of different linguistic practices, a task that feels like coming up with a ‘European’ translation of the word Blockchain, one that works across the whole of Europe.

The lack of a unified reference for translating blockchain to Arabic has been causing a myriad of issues. On one hand, it created a linguistic bottleneck, keeping most of quality blockchain content away from mono-lingual Arabs. On the other hand, without a standardized way to spell or translate essential keywords, SEO efforts targeting Arab readers will be significantly compromised.

The cost of translating blockchain content to Arabic remains high, as businesses end up developing their own glossaries throughout the translation process, which was the case with both the Ethereum Foundation and Binance. These de facto glossaries, while filling a gap, can in fact, and unintentionally, amplify the problem by introducing translation dispersion, where one term has two translations in two different glossaries, and translation biases, such as regional bias, where a translation is better understood in one part of the Arab region over the rest.

Translation difficulties tend to lead to deeper issues, such as lack of proper blockchain literacy, both on technical and general levels, which allows for more misinformation and stigma around the technology and its uses. That’s why it’s no wonder that MENA (Middle East & North Africa), a region that houses over 570M residents, remains one of the slowest regions in terms of blockchain and crypto currencies adoption in the world.

In a nutshell, this is why AbjaDAO exists!

AbjaDAO is a guild-type special purpose DAO, it’s named after the Arabic alphabet, which is usually abbreviated as ABJAD (similar to ABC). AbjaDAO brings together four MENA-based blockchain-focused initiatives, around a plan to develop a decentralized and unified Arabic blockchain glossary.

Our DAO includes representatives from ZeFi, a 40-people strong research and media project specialized in Arabic blockchain content. ZeFi were working on their own expansive dictionary when AbjaDAO came together, and they shared with us hundreds of translated and explained terms to use as a cornerstone. The DAO also includes Arabs in Blockchain initiative, founded by Eman Herawy, an Ethereum fellow who played a leading role in translating Ethereum to Arabic. Tafkir, a research and public goods center that conceived AbjaDAO, bringing to the table experienced academic and literary translators. And DocStream, a collective of editorial and translation service providers that serve the British Council amongst other clients.

Together, and joined by individual experts and consultants, we conceived a plan to develop a unifying glossary for Arabic blockchain terminology. We began by surveying a large body of blockchain literature to extract a list of nearly 1,400 terms, words and abbreviations. We are currently working on sorting these terms by frequency of use, and grouping them into thematic patches. In parallel, we are conducting a series of workshops to settle on translation philosophy and approaches. If you are an Arabic reader, you can track our progress on both tracks here (Listing and Patching Table, Translation Philosophy).

In the next phase of the project, we will conduct 4-hour workshops bringing together 7 translation experts from within and outside the DAO. Those translators will tackle a thematic patch of terms in every workshop, submit their different translations, and settle on the best translation through discussion or voting.

But translation is only half the answer. The other half would be propagation. For our translations to get picked up and start replacing former dispersed translations, we plan to follow the release of the glossary with a propagation campaign, aiming at having the glossary adopted by: 5 Arab colleges, 2 mainstream and 10 alternative pan-Arab media outlets, 25 blockchain-focused social media pages and influencers and 5 Arabic UI / UX websites or apps. We also plan to set up a Wikipedia grant, motivating translators to bring 20 essential blockchain pages to Arabic, using our glossary through translation.

The glossary will be a public good, and accessible to all for free. We hope to publish the first version of the glossary with 600-1000 terms translated, sometime before the end of the year (for a more detailed timeline, check our presentation!). After the initial release, we plan to update the glossary on 6-9 months intervals.

So far, we have received funding from the Solana Foundation through Tafkir, we also received logistical support from the Ethereum Foundation, who are sharing with us their own glossary to use as a point of reference. But we need further funding to see this project through. To support our DAO or learn more on our progress, you can download this presentation.

By providing tools to organise and hold transparent, fair and legitimate votes, THING seeks to expand, reinforce and protect democratic organisations and civil society on the planet. 

Users can create organizations in a web app and other users can register for these organizations. Members of organizations can create or participate in internal voting. They can create profiles, connect, form groups or write posts.
This privacy focused, easy to use app is made for non-technical users. All members have the same access to its functions and elections are auditable.

Lightpaper (PDF)
 
The Problem 
Traditional NGOs, clubs, local initiatives, political parties and other democratic organisations, suffer from slow scaling, asymmetric information distribution and manipulable voting. These challenges put at risk their functioning, the participation of their members and their impacts.

 
1.     Slow scaling: it takes an immense amount of resources and time to scale from a new political group into an influential political party (or any other organisation).
2.     Asymmetric information distribution: very often, organisations still run themselves like 100 years ago with mandatory on site events and voting. Pyramid-like structures emerge, with local groups moving up through delegates in higher groups to a few decision-makers at the top. Information (e.g. majority opinions, discussions) remains in the groups and is not distributed equally throughout the organization. Organization-wide consensus initiated from the bottom up may be difficult or impossible to achieve.
3.     Manipulable voting: the higher someone is in the structure, the easier it is for that person to control the pivotal players below them by using her / his power and resources. People in power can also control rules and format for communication and voting (e.g. how, when and where voting or an event takes place). Thereby they can influence election results or conversations in their favour.
 
The solution
THING addresses these issues by providing the following features:
§  Fast, simple & privacy focused authentication and decentralised ID (to address problem 1)
§  User friendliness and simple pre-set voting options (blockchain tech hidden) equally accessible to all members (to address problem 1)
§  Profiles, posts, comments, groups (to address problems 1 and 2)
§  Standardised, anonymous & auditable voting (to address problems 2 and 3)
 
More specifically, this React web app with blockchain backend will offer:
§  Authentication functions e.g. with tel. no. (possible technology: DID w/ KILT / Litentry)
§  Social media functions (possible technology: subsocial / DSNP)
§  Voting functions (possible technology: data on IPFS / arweave & contracts on Phala / Astar / Moonbeam)
 
The innovation
Our research shows that no similar solution is currently available on the market. While different features are available separately, no solution provides them all together.


 
The market
THING is being developed for groups such as new and existing political movements, political campaigns (e.g. running for a seat in congress) and civil society organisations of all sizes. We estimate that in geographical Europe only, there are 7.5 M potential political activists / organisers starting a group. We estimate that 750 K existing groups (clubs, associations, …) could use THING. We assume these groups to have roughly 75 M members in total. We need to validate these estimates through a detailed market analysis.
 
The roadmap
The concept is now finalised. We are working on a light paper and user research to deliver a prototype by the end of November. THING will then be fine tuned for different types of organisations in the EU and outside.
Once up and running, THING will be managed by an independent foundation running as a DAO.
 
Who we are
We are a bunch of web3 enthusiasts from different backgrounds with a genuine interest to support civil society and democratic processes. We are now in the incubation program “Polkadot Relayers 2022” and we are seeking support and funds to build a prototype. The grant will help us continue our work and hire technical experts and developers.

7490,Underground DAO: Alternative approaches to advancing the science of underground systems,0,0xfBb7fD977322A8026DD881e028D40337Cc113DcC,"Underground DAO
Sometimes called the ‘wood-wide web’, fungal networks connect above ground and below ground life, trees to one another, and break down rocks to extract minerals. We are only beginning to understand how these complex, decentralized networks coordinate collective action—but we do know that they have a profound implications for the climate, enabling 5 billions tons of CO2 to flow from plants to the underground every year. By partnering with SPUN: Society for the Protection of Underground Networks, Underground DAO will collaborate with the world’s leading experts on mycorrhizal fungi pioneer alternative approaches to advancing the science of underground systems. 

We need to act now
Three-quarters of terrestrial carbon is not stored in trees and plants, but rather underground in soil systems structured by mycorrhizal fungi. These overlooked keystone organisms have been a global blind spot in conservation and climate agendas. Understanding how these networks function—individually and collectively—and the urgent task of linking those functions to larger models of the global climate system so we can take action requires trans-disciplinary teams working in close collaboration.

Empowering citizen scientists
While the climate crisis is global, the science to address it requires activation at a hyperlocal level. Underground DAO will nurture and connect communities of local researchers and citizen scientists at a global scale, building on existing decentralized research programs. SPUN is already collaborating with remote sensing scientists with the common goal of mapping the global biodiversity of mycorrhizal networks.

New models for collaboration
In addition to scaling best practices, Underground DAO will create the conditions for emergence by enabling new peer-to-peer models for scientific collaboration. In this way, we can cultivate system-level discoveries that emerge only when research specializations interact in service of a broader mission.

DAO functions
Create synergies between diverse research specializations to accelerate scientific discovery
Engage geographically and culturally diverse scientific communities
Support independent research collaborations beyond institutional boundaries
Experiment with alternative incentives for engaging researchers from under-supported regions
Ensure that research gets credited appropriately
Enable talent and capital sourcing
Decrease the time it takes for new datasets to be made available
Share responsibility and ownership of decision-making
Empower local communities of citizen scientists to contribute to research

Starting with the science
SPUN is led by renowned evolutionary biologist Dr. Toby Kiers, and includes amongst its board members and advisors leading voices in climate action. We will work with SPUN to define Community Missions that seed self-organizing communities for maximum impact. The result of these collaborations will be made available as digital public goods.

Potential focus areas for Community Missions
Adaptation: How can we apply protocols and methodologies from diverse disciplines to the science of underground systems?
Aggregation: How can we develop common methodologies that ensure data and insights from adjacent disciplines are compatible and can be cross-referenced?
Innovation: What are the missing resources and tools that would accelerate underground science?

Modeling scientific collaboration to support the mission of mitigating climate change



Our funding model
The funds will be divided between platform development and incentivization
Introduce the SPUN community to the value of decentralized organizational structures and begin the onboarding process
Build the initial platform infrastructure with a unified interface and user experience that removes much of the friction of web3 onboarding and operations; specifically, integrate DAO tooling such as identity, forum, voting, reputation, contribution, and payment into a workflow.
Design and implement a coordination protocol based on co-created governance rules and voting procedures to enable scientific communities to self-organize around a scientific roadmap—as a first step to decentralization and automation.
Establish guidelines and design features for research collaboration, talent sourcing, and network support.

Rethinking DeSci incentive structures
DeSci incentives are often in conflict with existing means of conferring legitimacy within the scientific community. For example, academic scientists may be deeply suspicious of offers of individual incentives, because the introduction of the profit motive may be perceived as compromising their commitment to advancing science for science’s sake. Such incompatible incentive structures create a vicious cycle for DeSci initiates trying to establish legitimacy because they alienate established scientists.

The climate crisis provides a rare opportunity to realign priorities by adding environmental impact to the list of values the scientific community holds in common. In this way, academic science is not diminished or precluded, but alternative approaches that emphasize application and synthesis can be introduced alongside existing values.

By taking a “both-and” approach to incentivizing scientific research inside and outside the boundaries of the academic science community, Underground DAO is in a unique position to explore alternative funding and coordination models. These lessons can be abstracted and applied to other academic areas seeking to decentralize in service to a common cause.

We want to see web3 become increasingly diverse, inclusive, and equitable. Our mission is to find and equip web3 builders of tomorrow from currently underrepresented groups. 
 
First, we will form partnerships with other organizations that are targeting specific underrepresented communities (whether focused regionally, by language, by race or culture, by gender identity, etc). Our goal will be to provide support through tools, guidance, and resources, eventually building up a playbook that any similar community can use to equip and onboard a new group of people to web3. We plan to focus our initial support particularly in the area of web3 identity and credentials: helping participants build up a record of time and experience in the space. 
 
In the future we also hope to offer different sorts of “experiential learning” opportunities for these communities, like apprenticeships or residencies, where they could receive an income while learning and working.
 
 



The ultimate phase of the project will move towards incubating new web3 projects coming from these communities: projects not necessarily focused on DEI themselves, but founded by a team from these diverse communities.

 
We want to see many of the barriers-to-entry in web3 eroded. Our hope is that many of the underrepresented and under-capitalized groups gain the reputation to have access to 1) contributing to web3 projects, and then 2) gather teams to start web3 projects of their own. 

Our hope is that some of the least represented communities today can give birth to some of the most prominent and successful web3 founders of tomorrow. 



Why us?

The three of us met through the Hult Prize in the summer of 2021. We have experience working in nonprofits, web3, and startups. With expertise in operations, people management, and entrepreneurship.

Viktor worked in the past as Ecosystem Lead at StakerDAO and Educator at Braintrust through a grant and was recently accepted into Kernel as part of KB7 and CreatorDAO as part of the first cohort for the Creator Launchpad. Before entering Web3, he was the Event Lead for the Global Accelerator at Hult Prize and involved for 6 years. 

Linda started her journey with social entrepreneurship by co-founding a startup back in 2017 that won best social impact award in the international competition INJAZ. Later she joined the Hult Prize Foundation as a volunteer in her university, becoming later an intern, a regional associate, a community builder and then a regional manager. As a regional manager she managed and supervised 600+ university programs within the Europe and MENA region. She successfully led the efforts to expand the program to underrepresented regions and previous war zones such as Syria and Libya through closely working with United Nations agencies in the Middle East. 

Nate first met Linda and Viktor when his team Zeolife (focusing on helping smallholder farmers in Colombia), won the regional Hult Prize finals in Vienna, qualifying them for the global accelerator program. He then reconnected with Viktor while leading the “Web3 and Social Impact” elective with CCS (Crypto, Culture, and Society). Nate has also been contributing to Forefront DAO since February, where he helped set up the Season 2 onboarding process, and most recently helped organize and promote their Web3 Creator Residency.

Why?
Human culture is broken. The games we play are no fun. We are learning far too slow. You can feel it in every meeting, every day, that crushes the soul and bores you to death. We need better games. 

How?
LS are a small enough toolkit to learn and yet large enough to be useful. Learning to play and design these games opens up the entirety of design space that contains an infinity of possible forms. With enough people exploring this infinity we empower the possibility of a Cambrian explosion of games. With luck, we may survive long enough to invent/discover which games help us survive and regenerate the Earth.

7483,Baddies in Tech DAO: Championing Inclusion for WOC in Tech,0,0xf163d5c49E99EF90a0133054a537Bd301acB5e34,"Baddies in Tech is an organization on a mission to help women of color break into and belong in technology. Founded in 2019 by a Baddie who lacked a sense of belonging at her tech workplace, Baddies in Tech has since grown an organic community of 50K+ WOC supporting one another through our tech career journeys.

Core Thesis (Mission and Vision)

Throughout our three year community-building journey, we’ve had the privilege to explore first-hand 3 key problems that fuel the lack of diversity and inclusion for women of color in tech.

Problem #1
Women of color make up just 4-5% of people in computing roles. Our communities have been systemically denied access to tech education and work opportunities, and are currently playing catchup to onboard into Web2.

Problem #2
Only 8% of women of color say it is “easy” to thrive in the tech industry. We faced with un-inclusive and inequitable workplaces where we are often the only WOC on our teams, and bro-culture is the norm. As a result of this, almost 50% of female technologists leave the industry before the age of 30, further fueling the representation problem.

Problem #3
Sharing an unspoken mission, efforts by women of color technologists (and allies) to increase representation in tech spaces are often fragmented and siloed. By working individually, we move the needle instead of moving mountains.

We recognize the above as key barriers to women of color breaking into and growing careers in Web2 and Web3. We believe we can change this narrative, and our futures, by building BiTDAO - a decentralized collective of change-makers championing representation and inclusion for women of color in tech.

By bringing together our ideas, networks, and resources under a DAO, we aim to increase the representation of women of color in computing roles to 10% by 2030.

Mission:
To help women of color break into and belong in technology

Vision:
To increase the representation of women of color in computing roles to 10% by 2030

What progress have we made?

A Trusted Brand
Baddies in Tech has built a well-known brand in the DEI in tech space with our fierce focus on amplifying the experiences and voices of women of color technologists. As a grassroots movement with culture and representation at its heart, we are trusted name amongst current and aspiring tech professionals and are well positioned to encourage mass adoption of Web3 technologies by women of color.

An Inclusive Discord community
We’ve built a safe space in Discord for 1.5k+ Baddies to connect and uplift one another through our tech career journeys. Built to be a welcoming and inclusive environment, our Discord server is a digital home for the Baddies in Tech community to share experiences, advice, resources and mentorship.

A Mentorship Program
Our mentorship program has connected a cohort of aspiring tech baddies to mentors who can help them break into tech. We’ve seen amazing engagement from the mentors and mentees, and are working to expand the program to curate mentorship matches for as many community members as possible!

Online + IRL Events
Baddies in Tech has curated numerous online educational, recruiting and networking events for the community over the pandemic years. Recently we held our first IRL event in Atlanta, GA at the Render ATL conference. Baddie Tea Party was a blast and we are excited to create city chapters for BiTDAO members to continue to connect IRL!

Tech Educational Scholarships
We’re proud to have awarded over $35k in educational scholarships to aspiring tech baddies over the years. We plan to allocate a portion of our community treasury to continue to award micro-educational grants and scholarships for women of color to gain in-demand tech skills.

What’s Next?

We have established a strong core team and have begun making governance decisions to lay the groundwork for our DAO membership offering. Because we are onboarding a Web2 native community into Web3, we are being intentional with keeping the “why” of BiTDAO first and foremost. 



We plan on launching the DAO membership to the Baddies in Tech community in January 2023 with amazing membership perks such as an open source resource database and job board, online and IRL events, curated mentorship matching, and opportunities to contribute to earn social capital in the DAO.

We are still at the beginning stages of BiTDAO and would love your support during the GR15 round to raise funds to pay our core team, set up our DAO tooling/infrastructure, and create a treasury which will fund tech educational grants for women of color and other community initiatives.

7484,Friend’s of Pooly - DeFi Defenders,0,0xC876bEC4e02EACc92df0F7b6EEee90c2aD794E50,"Friends of Pooly is on a mission to defend decentralized finance; and to secure an Open Web3 through the power of Community. The PoolyNFT campaign, launched by the PoolTogether Inc team, was a month-long initiative to raise funds for a public good; defending decentralized finance.

Today, Friends of Pooly is continuing that objective with a Community powered fellowship.

Together we are securing an Open Web3.

Our Worldview

Problem: ⚔️
Cryptocurrency, blockchain and Web3 technologies are under attack.

Solution: 🛡️
Grassroots movements are emergent, antifragile and decentralized. A perfect defense in a digital world, plus an opportunity to advocate, educate and create fellowship.

The answer, as always, is a coalition of people, organizations and institutions who understand the importance of protecting at all costs freedom, liberty and the pursuit of happiness. Stemming from these core values is accessibility, security, digital ownership and privacy. All of which are required to empower and equip People in a new digital world - equipping every Persons with the tools and knowledge required to find sovereignty in a new Era of Network States.

We can scale global coordination with a new Internet. An Open Web3.

How
Friends of Pooly, stewarded by PoolTogether DAO contributors, is a project focused on advocacy, fellowship and education.

Advocacy: Support for blockchain/cryptocurrency policies and laws. 
Fellowship: Organizing resources and enabling Community led initiatives.  
Education: Help everyone start using Cryptocurrency and Web3 technologies

Stemming from the need to protect against an incoming onslaught of frivolous lawsuits, Friends of Pooly wants to proactively build a network of forward looking People, Organizations and Companies to defend against the *scum* that decides to come crawling out of the pond.

PoolTogether Inc, a well-known target, is just one of many companies being attacked right now. This trend will only continue. Now is the time to prepare: organizing networks and share resources.

Funds raised from the Gitcoin Grant will go towards Community Initiatives:

Open Web3 Constitution
Pooly Pals Adventures
Cryptocurrency Policy + Causes Newsletter
Coalition Building (Members,  Lawyers, Politicians, etc…)
Ethereum Network State Citizenship (Verifiable Credentials)

Initiatives are focused on vision alignment, building lore, adding immediate value to the conversation, growing a strong base of supporters and planting the seeds for continued growth and coordination.

As we continue to strengthen our core, we expect the Pooly Community to lead more initiatives, and more funds to become available for active contributors. The Friends of Pooly Stewards are committed to creating space for others to take charge and become active leaders and do-ers in the mission to secure an Open Web3.

Web3 is a do-acracy. And Pooly is the (r)evolution.

Why Friends of Pooly

Friends of Pooly is a small piece to a big puzzle. We want to defend DeFi and secure an Open Web3 through:

Art & Culture
Education & Outreach 
Technology & Systems Design

We believe Pooly is an embodiment of community and inclusivity. A symbol that represents both, securing an Open Web3 and a coalition of People who embody the best values of an emerging Ethereum Network State. Together we can bring to life a future worth fighting for.

Our strengths will be using art and culture to power education and outreach efforts. Additionally as we begin to scale up Friends of Pooly we want to democratize access to powerful Web3 technologies i.e make crowdsourcing public goods accessible to everyone.

Our Ask from the Ethereum Community
We want You to join the mission to secure an Open Web3.

“If you want to go fast go alone, if you want to go far go together.”

Cryptocurrencies and blockchain technologies have entered the mainstream zeitgeist. With an intense focus from People, Organizations and Governments all over the world, it’s becoming more and more obvious *things* are happening.

What exactly? We don’t know. That story is unfolding as we speak.

But together we can front-run and out-smart the attack.

Join us and become a #DeFiDefender.

7485,Launch MECX DAO: Empowering Marginalized Creatives,0,0xa590Ec5D98877B5E8eb423055EEa476b6F9ceF15,"THE PROBLEM: Along with the financial hurdles of not having enough disposable income or the understanding of how to generate it, marginalized communities suffer from a lack of technical competency, mostly due to an inability to bridge the information gap, and social hurdles such as not being in, having access to or knowing how to infiltrate the ""right"" networks. These limiting factors contribute to the continued marginalization of 100s of millions of people worldwide.

THE SOLUTION: To tackle these problems head-on we're aiming to partner with leading research groups in the Web3 space ie. Messari, Dune Analytics, Anchain Ai, Pulsr Ai, Talent DAO and Web3 Women in Science to name a few, in order to conduct analysis of demographic, crypto earnings, reputation and referral data, within our community and the larger Web3 eco-system to:
Validate the need to further onboard marginalized communities, hence, diversifying Web3.
Justify all future requests for funding related to the production and dissemination of educational content and tangible resources/means of support to marginalized talent in the Web3 space.
Measure the efficacy and success of our educational initiatives to ensure they are replicable.

THE CURRICULUM: We've developed a comprehensive Web3 curriculum to help onboard and upskill those who might otherwise be left behind. With modules like ""the importance of the smart contract"" and ""how-to to fund your web3 project"", our video masterclass will lay out the fundamental understandings necessary to successfully operate in Web3. Beyond the video course work, through s system of bounties, we will employ the savviest Web3 educators in the space, to provide live help, in our proprietary learning platform as well.



THE FOUNDER:
My name is Mec Zilla and I’m a Multi-Disciplinary Artist, Design Director & Strategist who has designed and developed campaigns for brands such as Disney, Marvel, UMG, Verizon, Coca-Cola, Heineken, Vice Media, Afro-Punk, and the like, for over 20 years. 

WEB3 ROLES:
Web3 Consultant - Converse / Jordan / Nike
Innovation Consultant - @Deadfellaz
Consultant/Former Head of Community - @A0K1VERSE
Education/ DE&I Consultant - @SuperchiefNFT
Multi-Sig Signer - @ExpansionPunks
NFT Strategy Consultant - @Explorest
Graduated Fellow - @FWBtweets

THE REPUTATION:
Since discovering ""crypto art"" in a clubhouse room in December of 2020, I became known for my penchant for hosting the longest Web3-centric AMA rooms. Additionally, I've come to be known as ""the woman who explained NFTS to Gary Vee"" and almost 1 year later ""the marathon host"" after single-handedly running an 18hr Twitter space titled ""The Death of Opensea"" where over 30,000 users discussed building a decentralized and community-owned marketplace.



BECOMING AN EDUCATOR:
It was that experience that solidified my ability to help others understand the space. However, the more I learned about the space the more disheartened I became by the layers of friction I was faced with and my sheer inability to effectively connect with the community that was forming around me. After a 4 month break from all social media, I returned with a fresh perspective and focus on doing what I could to make the space as fair and equitable as possible.

BECOMING AN ADVOCATE:
While navigating the Web3 space as an educator and impact worker I've been invited to converse with various data science organizations including @anchain_ai, @pulsr_ai, and @TalentDAO as well as politicians such as @AndrewYang, @AarikaRhodes, @GregTanaka, @ShannonBrayNC and @DanWhitCongress. And it's thanks to these conversations that I've been able to lend my voice in support of the research that validates my efforts to diversify Web3 as well as to advocate against public policy issues like impending cryptocurrency regulations and the destruction of reproductive rights in much larger public forums.


 
THE MISSION:
After a solid year of developing curriculum and building community, it's time to start onboarding the next 10,000 non ""white guys"" to enter the Web3 space and providing the tangible support needed to upskill, place, and accelerate our community members. It is through this work that we can effectively establish ourselves as the #1 resource for diverse talent in the Web3 space and foster a more fair and equitable future. 

Funds received from this grant will help up with our top 5 priorities at the moment:
Establishing and Incorporating the DAO and sorting tax and trademark logistics 
Create a census as part of our Web3 onboarding and conduct user research with our aforementioned partners
Continued public speaking on education, DE&I and public policy advocacy.
Producing a high-quality video series of our comprehensive Web3 curriculum * 
Funding bounties that our community educators can claim to host live spaces in support of our video curriculum

So please make your donation today and help up build something epic!

7488,The ReGen Games! Like the Olympics for Regeneration,0,0x21F9F77f867E321Df0747ad62e96602Bd603E734,"The Olympic Games, Medieval Games, Dog & Horse races, etc... were originally designed around training those societies to prepare against their most pressing existential threats. Physical combat and direct warfare.

Jousting, sword fighting, running, spear throwing, pole vaulting (e.g. spear troops jumping over short walls), rowing, war horses/dogs, etc all designed around feats of combat. 
 
Today, our society's, indeed humanity's, existential threat is no longer just physical combat. Our threat is a global civilization (supply chains, economic systems, etc) in crises on its way towards collapse. 

A crises in: 
meaning and purpose
relationship and love
regeneration and thrivability 
etc

We need to train for this transition, honing the skills that will help us succeed in co-creating a diversity of Regenerative Civilizations and Societies and demonstrating skills in unique feats of physical strength won't do it.

So, what is the equivalent to today's sports-based Olympics for Regenerative Civilizations?

Well, for starters these Games are 'infinite games' governed by the people who participate in them. So, the answer to the question of ""how do the Games look"" will constantly evolve and change.

However, there are some principles the Games will follow:

The ReGen Games exists to help us joyfully train for transition into a diversity of land-based regenerative economic systems. 

Learning the skills: 
Permaculture 
Natural building
Wild harvesting
etc
Gaining the tools:
Onboarding into Web3
DAOs
ReFi, REcon, ReGov,
New finacial and economic systems to coordinate within and design place-based economies 
and providing the spaces from which to co-create our new Regenerative Civilizations from. Which we do in partnership with the ""ReGen Civics Alliance"" which is a growing alliance of land-based regenerative economies.  

We're mixing the best parts of:

Summer Camp with 
Dungeons and Dragons (or The Amazing Race, whatever is most familiar) with
IRL ""We-opoly”(Cooperative Monopoly) with 
The ReGenerative Renaissance to co-create... 
 
Epic multi-day Games (like the Olympics) to have a ton of fun co-learning about:
 
ReFi 
DAOs 
Permaculture, syntropic agroforestry, gardening 
Conflict Evolution 
Earthship Building  
Wild Harvesting and Mushroom Cultivation  
Cooking with wild food 
Adventure skills Camping, fire starting, survival skills 
Small team time-constrained coordination 
Deep dialogue (with the land and each other)  
and so much more!

The games take place at the ReGen & ReFi DAO Campus in North Carolina:
200 acres including a lake and several ponds and you feel like you're in the center of a summer camp while being
Abundance of fresh water year round
Healthy and nourished soil, being a Permaculture garden (with syntropic food forests going up each spring) 
Lake for daily kayaking, sailing, etc
20 minutes to the AVL (Asheville NC) airport
5 minutes to town (co-op for organic food and grocery stores, gas, etc of ""Flat Rock"" NC)
We started our search in the Appalachians as this is an incredible Bioregion
Avoiding many of the climate catastrophes expected (if we don't reverse course fast enough) in the US
3 seasons and food security (the land already has Gardens and space to easy scale up to meet the food needs of the Campus & Games)
A center of biodiversity (most biodiverse in the US) and beauty and a potential to heal from (e.g. we can start at the source of our water to make our lake drinkable)
Neighbors a *massive* city park and golf course (green surroundings)
Existing infrastructure to host events, games, etc for 1000+ people (more if we expand our infrastructure) 
stages
kitchens
cafe's
10 cabins (20 with renovations)
dorms
camping areas
amphitheater
boat house 
etc


View of approximately 1/3 of the lake at the center of the ""~200-350 acre Game Board""

Grant milestones and funds use

If we reach $50,000 in donations then Grant participants will be first to be notified when ticket sales go live by a full 48 hours before other channels are used. 

Team Tickets = those who want to be part of a 3-7 person team to run through the ""In Real Life Game Board"" earning ""Coins"" and other prizes for completing quests and overall rank.
Active Crowd Tickets = those who want to participate in and watch the games from the sidelines.  
 
All funds raised with this grant will go towards ""The ReGen Games"":
regenerating and making more fertile and abundant the land as a vital diverse ecosystem. 
Adding more tools and resources for teams who are participating in the games (camping equipment, boats, tools, etc) - similar to the Hunger Games where participants were airdropped equipment. Donations help teams have tools to become more regenerative! and, 
reducing the ticket price (as the Games are not for profit) the more funds we raise the cheaper we can make the tickets for teams and attendees (With the goal of making the Games free with a merit/lottery style selection process to select teams). If this grant raises enough to make the games free and we give 48 advanced notice to Gitcoin Grant participants when Game tickets go live; it may turn out that the Games are mostly the Gitcoin community!

Furthest Stretch goal: Once we've raised a total of $10M we'll buy the resort that is next to the Game Board extending out our lodging capacities and using the revenue from the resort to fund the Games; if this is still a wise move come that time. The resort would be transferred to a Trust governed by a DAO (watch the episodes on Legal for more details here) of all those who've participated in making The ReGen Games a reality.

### Our tags: 
#OpenGaming
We started with the idea ""how can we make co-creating IRL regenerative villages into an epic multiplayer game, so that this transition can be as fun, engaging, and purposeful as possible?
We're open-sourcing the whole “ReGen Games” model so that other ReGen Villages may make Games themselves, as we have an epic time co-creating Solarpunk civilizations, ReGen Villages and more!  

 #DeSci
﻿We're transforming this old summer camp neighborhood into a ""ReGen Campus"" and Incubator for startup cities/towns using DAOs to co-create and experiment with regenerative economic systems. We're co-creating a learning campus and permanent ""Game Board"" (consisting of both digital tools (e.g. teaching DAOs and DHOs) and IRL “Summercamp-esque campus” - see pictures below) for experimenting with designing alternative civilizations, ReGen Economies, Startup Cities, Networked States, and more all built on top of Web3 and our decentralized global database to coordinate a global Renaissance to ReGenerate Earth.   

We're open sourcing all our technology (wallets, templates, DAO builders, village templates, coordination hacks, and more) to accelerate the transition to Regenerative Cultures.   

#Web3Social
This is all to build the IRL campuses and villages where we can bring our web3 friendships into the real world and move out of our Discord/Zoom meetings and into the community food forests, berry patches, and natural swimming pools. 

#ClimateSolutions
We're doing all of this to (as effectively as possible) build the foundations we need to coordinate a global ""ReGenerative Renaissance”, that's about coordinating the transition to regenerative cultures. Which we believe is mandatory to address our climate crises.

### Who we are:

The ReGen Games is a part of the ReGen Civics Alliance. 

We're a global IRL community starting with 13+1 different ReGen projects each season 
2 examples: click here to explore the others!

The 10,000 ft idea is for our tribes we've been building Web3 to move to physical pieces of land together to regenerate and prototype a diversity of startup regenerative civilizations. To help us in our transition The ReGen Games acts as an incubator for ReGen Villages.   

For example 1 of the 13 projects from Season 1 of ReGen Civics, after they've completed their   ""Crowdpooling"" event, where up to 144 people who have been selected to be part of their ""Minimum Viable Regenerative Economy"" will attend a 3 month ReGen Village incubator to facilitate the 144 people through a process of them co-creating the foundations for their startup society. For example helping projects create their:  
economic systems 
governance systems 
conflict evolution protocols  
teaching skills in permaculture, natural building, etc 
etc   
The 3 month incubator ends in the participants demonstrating their skills by putting on a   ""ReGen Games” where they take teams of 3-7 players through their “Squares” where they each put on a unique experience, quest, challenge, learning journey, for teams who play the game over a 2-3 day weekend event. Those who are part of the ReGen Village incubator run The ReGen Games for anyone to participate as a team or attend and spectate/participate in the audience (they’ll be multiple ways the audience interacts with teams).
 
### Game board elements include:  



The first Regen Games will be held across a ~350 acre site. Including: 
a large kitchen/cafe
a Community/Market Garden
an Earthship home construction site 
a machine/woodshop 
A natural swimming pool construction site turned wrestling pit
An archery and ropes course 
Lake, ponds and beaver dams 
Forests, food-forests, gardens, and meadows
New syntropic agroforestry gardens  
and many more elements   
 
The first version of the ""ReGen Games Guide” will be released and open-sourced after the Alpha test of the game in October 2022. To give a taste of what teams might expect from the Games as they earn coins and race against the clock/other teams to:

1. 'Companion plant' some plants in the food forest (earning various amounts of coins depending on what and how plants were planted, etc)
 
2. Deep dialogue to address and evolve through an emotional community tension scenario (Square Master gives coins based on the teams solution, etc)
 
3. Send any amount of tokens to ReGen Civics DAO (Celo, Eth, SEEDS, etc) and participate in the Games governance DAO/DHO demonstrating knowledge of various economic tools.
 
4. DAO/Community governance scenario helping weave 2  ""competing"" ideas into a 3rd unifying idea (Square Master gives coins based on the teams solution, etc)
 
5. Sing a song on the spot. Be given a tune and a theme and come up with a song (scored by points for how well the song pleased the square masters' listening organs).
 
6. Pound N tires at the EarthShip house building site, or create N bricks for an earthen oven, etc the more your team can create in 15 min the more Coins you earn! 
 
7. Transport you and your team to the island in the middle of the lake where you have to solve riddles to find a clue that guides you to your next square on the other side of the lake.
 
8. Identity and harvest 10 different wild/edible plants/fungi (coins based on the rarity (such as special edible mushrooms), diversity, and quantity of the harvest)
 
9. Dance!
 
10. Inoculate some logs with mushrooms that become part of the wild Harvest square of future Games11. And a vast universe of possibilities as Square Masters along and in co-creation with the land their square represents, design a unique experience for teams as we co-create a joyful and exciting globally ReGenerative Renaissance. 
 
An alpha version of the games is set for the first weekend of October with the first Official ReGen Games going live summer/fall 2023!

7493,ATX DAO: Developing grassroots DAO legislation,0,0x407Cf0e5Dd3C2c4bCE5a32B92109c2c6f7f1ce23,"ATX DAO is a grassroots community of Web3 professionals working with the Texas government to draft DAO LLC legislation. Our work ensures such legislation solves real problems without restricting privacy, practicality, or decentralization. Funds raised will directly benefit these efforts by incentivizing wider participation and supporting community education and advocacy, allowing us to more effectively crowdsource our policy recommendations. Watch this 90-second video to learn more about us.


Background
For several months, our volunteers have been working with the state’s Work Group on Blockchain Matters to inform on DAO legal frameworks and how they might be improved. On August 19th, we were formally invited to testify at the Capitol about this issue (twitter summary, full video, full written testimony). We have since been asked to provide more comprehensive recommendations and to participate in the drafting of legislation, which requires substantial research, strategy, coordination, and time. 

As an impact DAO, our primary goal is not monetization, but contribution to public goods. As such, community involvement and creative funding mechanisms are critical for us to operate effectively. Funds raised by this grant will go towards sponsoring these efforts and creating paid opportunities for a more representative group of Austin’s Web3 community to contribute, allowing us to maintain a higher level of engagement and expertise. This will also include education and grass roots advocacy, which will support and inform our work with state government.

It is critical that Web3 native DAO contributors with on-the-ground experience participate in this legislative process, and our ability to make this happen represents an incredible opportunity. ATX DAO’s continued work in this important area ensures that any legislation passed in Texas will solve real problems for DAOs while protecting decentralization, privacy, practicality, and the autonomy of members.

About Us
ATX DAO is an impact DAO working to unite Austin's crypto communities, enable artists and local businesses to participate in the crypto ecosystem, and educate the government about the benefits of Web3. As a democratic network of developers, artists, and crypto professionals, the DAO provides expertise to local and state government, organizes social events to onboard new web3 users, and helps the best minds in blockchain connect, coordinate, and collaborate in service of public goods.

Since the beginning of the year, ATX DAO volunteers have been extremely active in local politics. In January, we hosted a networking event for our members and local legislators to encourage dialogue and build connections between Austin’s Web3 and political communities. In March, multiple members worked together to deliver oral and written testimony to Austin’s city council, providing crucial advice on whether to adopt a “city coin”, similar to Miami. This 17-page fact finding study demonstrated our ability to distill complicated information such as tokenomics, smart contract scripting languages, and token utility in clear language that was accessible to policy makers and government officials. Through this testimony, we received interest from policy makers to continue and expand the dialogue around web3 policy. 

Following successful development of DAO legal frameworks in Texas, we will continue on to other key issues such as stablecoin regulation, data privacy, and matters of securitization, based on input from the community and policy makers.

7494,Internet of Animals: An Open-Source Tracking Community,0,0x9Fcc55e782c2E43DFADCC428C4F2f8f32E095782,"The Wildlife Movement Institute Mission
Our mission is to create a community of scientists that promotes the designing, development, implementation, and improvement of accessibility to software, hardware, and knowledge resources related to wildlife movement ecology. To realize that vision, we formed The Wildlife Movement Institute, a nonprofit organization to be a hub for this community for local, regional, and international collaborations – whether you are an expert or someone passionate about wildlife and technology.
Problems Addressed and Why This Matters
The overarching theme of this community is a synthesis of movement ecology and tracking technology. As movement is essential for everything an animal does in its lifetime, understanding animal movement helps us understand how individuals select habitats, life history traits, and residence patterns. This information can provide information necessary to improve species protection under anthropogenic threats, from climate change to human encroachment. Climate change is more pressing now than ever. Understanding how native and non-native wildlife respond to climate change is critical to their management and conservation.

Status Quo and How We Plan to Change That
Although radio telemetry has been used to monitor animal movements since the mid-1960s, it was not until the invention of GPS loggers that truly detailed observations of individual movements became possible. However, commercial, proprietary animal tracking systems are expensive and often out of reach for researchers. The number of trackers that can be purchased is too low to gain robust information, thus stifling innovation and vital information to inform species management. The growing trend of using microcontrollers to design tracking units is undoubtedly a revolutionary movement in wildlife movement ecology. Technology does not care what animal it tracks, so long as it does not impede mobility when attached.

Despite the growing community of tracking biologists creating a higher demand for movement data, there is not a community dedicated to supporting the development of accurate, affordable, open-source trackers and related software and methods. We plan to decentralize the development and manufacturing of animal tracking devices which are integral to the success of our community, leveraging DeSci and other Web 3.0 tools. These tools will support developing a well-governed, decentralized community and document published workflows to replicate and easily build upon prior work. Ned is a DeSci Labs beta tester for DeSci Nodes and is actively engaging with a number of DeSci projects to learn how best to apply and participate in the development of those tools to realize our vision.

What we want to accomplish
Our primary goal is to build a community to support the open-source development and application of animal tracking software, hardware, and methods to economically and ethically track animal movements. Some initial ideas toward reaching that goal include:
Leveraging tools being developed as part of the decentralized science (DeSci) movement to fund, publish, organize, and equitably acknowledge and reward the work and accomplishments of individuals to learn from prior successes and failures more efficiently and effectively,
Implementing existing hardware to the extent practical and designing new hardware when sensible for reliable trackers suitable for a broad range of taxa,
Developing software to facilitate customizing movement recording protocols and real-time tracking,
Generating and distributing funding to support work done by community members, and
Promoting scientific literacy with the public through the community as an outreach platform through visualization of animal movement data and open-source content for biologging development.

Why we need help
Although The Wildlife Movement Institute was created over a year ago, the progress toward creating a community has been slow. Funds raised through this grant round will be used to finalize the legal requirements required to gain 501c3 status and accomplish a number of tasks largely by offering bounties. Some tasks and anticipated near-term budget expenditures include:
Upgrading our web platform to organize and sustain a community
Migrating and managing the existing GitHub site to a Wildlife Movement Institute GitHub site
Covering costs for the development and production of a new board for tracking small to medium-sized animals
Providing funding for bounties to support website development and create documentation related to building, programming, and deploying animal trackers

An Unexpected Journey: How We Got Here
The journey leading up to this grant proposal started in 2019 when Lam Ngo, a student at Sewanee The University of the South, contacted Ned Horning about different options for tracking Diamondback Terrapins, a mostly aquatic turtle living along coastal areas. Based on Ned’s background with GPS and GNSS technology, and after some tinkering, a small DIY proof of concept tracker that provided tracking information in real-time was created, costing less than a fraction of a proprietary tracker using cutting-edge Long-Range (LoRa) technology and Long-Range Wireless Access Network (LoRaWAN) protocol in tandem with The Internet of Things (IoT). In 2020 Ned created the Terrapin Tracker project, which was a finalist for the Con X Tech Prize managed by Conservation X Labs, and he was able to form a small team to refine the trackers and related software.

Linked by a common study organism, the diamondback terrapin, Jason Alstad reached out and suggested the creation of an organization to support open-source support for animal tracking. In the spring and summer of 2021, the first prototype trackers were tested in the field in South Carolina and Georgia. Unfortunately, the trackers did not perform as well as expected due to the animal’s behavior, and the process of learning from our mistakes began.

In the Spring of 2022, we implemented the next generation of trackers on Blandings Turtles, a semi-aquatic turtle in the Hudson Valley of New York. Through this collaborative work with The Wetland Trust, we met Adam Parlin, a post-doc at the State University of New York College of Environmental Science and Forestry. Adam had previously worked with tracking technology on turtles, from electrocardiogram and GPS in free-living individuals. He has been working on applying those techniques to studying squirrel movements based on some of his tracker designs this fall.

7495,ReSci Network: Scientific Collaboration for Ecosystem Regeneration,0,0x9D120Bee68ed792884D340f911D8434306b28605,"What?
ReSci Network is a catalyst for community in decentralized science for ecosystem regeneration.  We’re a community hub for applied research and a playground for the creation of next-generation collaborative tooling and research funding channels. 

Problem Statements
1. Lack of dedicated community center for regenerative decentralized science
2. Lack of funding from ReFi for regenerative scientific activity 
3. Need for onboarding support for scientists into web3

There is a need to bring regenerative scientists to the web3 space. Historically, the DeSci community has centered around biomedical sciences. We’re addressing a need for a community hub dedicated to the collaboration of decentralized ecosystem regeneration and providing the support for onboarding scientists into web3. We create channels for funding and attract scientists to share a wide variety of expertise. 

How? 
Use an existing community organizing tool (Discord) to build out specific working group centers. We support methodology development in collaboration with existing efforts and channel external funds from the ReFi ecosystem into legitimate research projects.

	The working groups we will focus on to start include: 
	1. Marine Ecosystems
	2. Terrestrial Ecosystems
	3. Regenerative Agriculture Systems

Let ordinary people have more opportunities to participate in Move's blockchain ecosystem.
  At present, the new blockchains of Move language represented by Aptos and Sui are developing rapidly, and the financing amount has reached a new high under the overall market downturn, and the consensus that the new blockchains based on Move language will become the next bull market leader is getting stronger and stronger. The new blockchain represented by Aptos also opens a new model of capital public chain, and the opportunity for ordinary people to participate is getting less and less.. MoveDAO provides a new model of participation in the Move ecosystem, and through the power of the community, MoveDAO will provide continuous support to the Move ecosystem through education, talent training, project promotion and project incubation, and gain knowledge, opportunities and economic returns from them, most of which will be distributed to the members of the DAOs.
  Currently, MoveDAOs community has more than 120 members, including senior developers from Amazon, Ali, Tencent and other major companies, as well as resident representatives of capitalists. The project currently has an education group, an ecosystem research tracking group, and a promotion group operating independently. A lot of document translation work has been done, while more high-quality projects are on the way to launch.

Fundraising plan：

If the total amount of funds raised, 1~100,000U
will be raised for the promotion and growth of the organization, mainly for community promotion activities and the output of Move education courses. The community is currently in a better upswing, and with the funding boost, we will be able to hold more quality Space events and rapidly expand the community's influence.
In addition to educational and research expenses for the promotion and Move language, the rest of the funds will be used to reward outstanding proposals and to make early investments in Move eco-projects. The proceeds from the investment will be returned to the community and investors.

If the total amount of funds raised, 100,000~1,000,000U
In addition to the necessary team expenses, the funds will be mainly used for Move language ecosystem, professional talent training output, and providing ecosystem support services, cultivating 1~5 direct ecosystem projects, and establishing sufficient ecosystem influence.

If the total amount of fundraising is higher than 1 million U
We will set up an incubation fund jointly with project parties and capitalists, rely on MoveDAO's resource advantage in Move ecosystem and information advantage, and invest in excellent projects in Move ecosystem. At the same time, we will develop professional services such as technical services and talent training, and obtain returns from these aspects.

We promise that the use of all donated funds will be regularly publicized and supervised by donors.

Minidomn is a launchpad for Web3-native investing DAOs. It is a decentralized platform and network that enables investors and communities to create Web3-native investing DAOs. It also provides infrastructure and tools for investing DAOs to socially network, invest in real world and maintain compliance.

It is a great way for friends or funds to form investing DAOs to invest in crypto startups, NFTs, DeFi and other crypto-native assets. However, the complexity of launching and running an investing DAO, particularly compliantly, can be overwhelming even to experienced crypto users.

Minidomn makes it easy to channel money into a multi-sig and invest with your network. Since everything is on-chain, distributions happen automatically via smart contracts. Meanwhile, Minidomn also limits the personal liability of investment DAO members by giving DAOs the option to compliantly connect to LLCs and other real physical capabilities.

Social Layer is a subjective, relational and programmable Soulbound NFT-based social network.

It allows individuals and organization to send badges to each other, generating a new kind of social graph based on badges instead of ""follow"" relations.

The new badge-based social network lays the foundation for unleashing the potential of social capital. Also, it creates a visualizing tool for understanding how decentralized societies are structured and then allows anyone to quickly establish a community using programmable badge systems designed by other successful communities.

Past and Next

For the past half year, a team of 7 part-time contributors developed a demo app and showcase it for the first time during the biggest Web3 conference in Dali, China this August. The dApp now has the basic features of sending, receiving and displaying the badges.

Next, we are plan to share with a much greater community at Devcon about how Social Layer can help create unique and memorable person-2-person connections using SBT, apart from everyone receiving the exact same POAP.

For next year, one of our two priorities is to display the unique social graph for everyone. Based on the issuance and reception of badges, users can see straightaway how he is connected by badges with people at two or more degrees of separation, that is, how anyone in a big conference like Devcon is related to him.

The other priority is to diversify badge modules so as to allow users to combine the suitable ones to meet their needs to record different types of information, such as witness, roles, skills, achievements and tickets, to fit various contexts like DAO, creator platforms and philanthropic sector.

Blockchain technology, real estate, business launchpads, and investments are common themes on popular decentralized crowdfunding sites.
 
As these platforms are filling a gap within the web3 space, they are not focused on everyday fundraisers.
 
ENS is one of the most powerful namespaces we have at our disposal, and we've already established an organization building a censorship-resistant immutable decentralized crowdfunding platform with low fees (plus transaction expenses) and on-demand withdrawals.

Users will be able to donate using subdomains of the main ENS domain, web3fundme.eth, while accepting a variety of cryptocurrencies.
 
Fundraisers will have the option to reward their contributors with NFTs in exchange for their donations.
 
ENS can be complicated to set up and not every user will understand how to work with it. We plan to utilize the platform to simplify crowdfunds for new users to the blockchain and help them get started by opening and connecting a wallet and depositing funds directly while utilizing ENS and its subdomains.
 
Importantly, the Web3 FundMe platform will provide opportunities to market ENS as a whole and to future fundraisers and contributors from all over the world.

A strong emphasis will be placed on crowdsourcing to onboard both Solidity and Full-Stack developers, digital artists, and social media content creators.

7505,Otomee: The Metaverse Hub,0,0x02aCb57384d82c6F0875030032b3f248EB46b327,"A censorship-resistant Hub for The Metaverse, a place communities can call home. Create and exchange value with 0% fees.

Otomee is an open, peer-to-peer, decentralized and censorship-resistant Hub where communities can create highly customizable experiences for their members, generating utility and a greater sense of belonging. Otomee also features a built-in marketplace where communities decide the rules, with fees as low as 0%.

Why is your contribution important?

In recent months, the web3 ecosystem has suffered from censorship attacks against communities and individuals, delisting their assets from the leading platforms in the industry. It is ironic that a movement such as web3 whose ethos is openness, transparency and decentralization, doesn't have truly permissionless tools. We are here to give power back to individuals. 

Here's to the crazy ones. The misfits. The rebels. The ones who see things differently...




How will your contribution help us?

Otomee is a public infrastructure for the web3 ecosystem, and we need your help bootstrap the platform. Your contributions will be used to pay for audits, deploy smart contracts to the mainnet, ensure the platform can pay for querying from The Graph, and allow us to keep developing until Otomee becomes self-sustainable.

A built-in, open marketplace.



Otomee aims to be the place where communities can have all they need to thrive. With a built-in, open marketplace, your community can exchange NFTs and decide whether they want to pay royalties or transact completely free.
Otomee introduces a new user-centric model where individuals will be able to curate NFT listings from different communities and present them on their themed profile page, under the Curation tab. All sales made through the user’s Curation page will give him a % of the sale defined by him, creating new markets and opportunities for individuals to leverage the metaverse economy.

A Highly customizable Presentation card:



Otomee will give communities and individuals the tools they need to express themselves through their collections, offering artists, communities and collectors full control over the look and feel of their profiles and pages so they can be used as the ultimate way of representing their whole identity in one place.
These features will remain decentralized and on-chain in the form of NFTs with gas efficiency and flexibility as top priorities. Creators will also be able to share their custom themes with the world. It will be up to them to decide how they will be distributed: be it in the form of an airdrop to their communities, a free mint or if they want to charge for them. This opens a completely new sea of possibilities for communities and creators to connect.

Onboarding brands and communities to the Metaverse:

It is important to create easy ways for traditional brands and communities to dip their toes into the metaverse. Otomee helps them with one-click SC deployments from a preset of the most popular NFT standards and drop strategies, with automatic integration to the Otomee ecosystem.

ENS at its core.

Otomee implements Sign In with Ethereum and ENS as its authentication system, implementing resolution for ENS names and avatars, but more importantly, giving communities a subdomain of Otomee.eth for their community page, helping them avoid phishing scams. Any modifications in example.otomee.eth is much easier to spot than otomee.eth/0xabcd…. Besides, settings like community themes and royalty settings (If set) will be saved in text records of the community’s subdomain.

Otomee uses ENS to power the platform and you can use Otomee to power your ENS experience.



ENS users will have an intuitive interface to easily customize their ENS text records and set their NFTs as ENS avatars with one click, or using non-NFT images dragging and dropping to upload them directly to IPFS. If set, these text records like description, location and social media handles will be displayed in their Otomee profile.
To leverage Otomee’s built-in, censorship-resistant marketplace, the ENS community will be able to buy and sell ENS names with ENS-specific filters and 0% fees.

The architecture: 🤓




Otomee has been designed with decentralization as a top priority. It features a serverless architecture using technologies like the EVM, IPFS to store the Web App itself, orders, setting and themes; Orbitdb to manage the data, The Graph to index blockchain information of NFTs and SCs, and ENS to logically structure the platform. None of these services has a single point of failure and every line of code of the platform is open source, thus creating a self-sustainable marketplace that everyone can use, no one can control, anyone can verify and no one can stop.

The Roadmap:
Marketplace Smart contracts
Built-in marketplace
Default Community page and User profiles
ENS regular and reverse lookups integration
Core subgraphs
MVP (Compile source code and run on the Rinkeby Network)
Template engine integration (Themes)
ENS subdomain system
ENS profile editing page
One-click SC compiler and deployer

How you can help:

If you believe Otomee can add value to you or your community and would like to support the project, here are two ways you can do it:
The code is open source and PRs are welcome!
If you want to contribute through the Grant round, even a $1 contribution will help us massively pay for SC deployments in mainnet and subgraph queries and auditing!

Committable aims to create a community where

1) the contributions of developers are acknowledged ""by algorithms""

2) incentives are distributed to developers based on their contributions in a transparent style.

3) open-source project donators know where their donations are going and the outcomes from their contributions.



Committable aims to expand the developer community with transparency and make open-source projects, whether large or small, sustainable.


Besides those mentioned above, we also think Committable is a good platform for

- attracting new donators who want to contribute to the Ethereum community and open-source projects.

- encouraging new developers to the web3 world to have some feedback to acknowledge their contributions, whether large or small.

- connecting donators and developers in the web3 world and on open-source projects.



Better web3 buidl experience

- supporters exchange their goodwill into a prosperous web3 world

- developers can continuously contribute to the web3 world, with acknowledgement and honour. 


What technologies are behind Committable?

Program Analysis

The code that our developers write is text with syntax and semantics. With the help of the technique called ""program analysis"", we can peek into how a piece of code works and how much effort and contribution it contains in a further step.

Trusted Computing

With the help of trusted computing technologies, the program analysis algorithm can run in an unbiased environment which means anyone can repeat an analysis process and get the same result.

Decentralisation

Committable is born on Ethereum. Like other dApps, Committable's data are generated and kept on Ethereum. Committable benefits from the composability of the Ethereum ecosystem. As a part of this system, Committable also can be composed of other protocols.

7474,ValleyDAO - Democratizing Climate Synthetic Biology,0,0xD920E60b798A2F5a8332799d8a23075c9E77d5F8,"ValleyDAO is an open community collectively financing and enabling fair access to synthetic biology (SynBio) technologies to protect the future of our planet. We’re utilizing a novel intellectual property (IP) framework called an IP-NFT, which enables funding, owning and transacting IP in an open and distributed market while preserving privacy and protection. In simple terms, it allows a decentralized entity like a DAO to own, curate and distribute IP. The IP-NFT framework has been validated by VitaDAO, which funds longevity and therapeutics research. 

“SynBio is a toolbox that enables scientists to engineer the DNA of microorganisms to sustainably produce - among other things - cultured meats and textiles, and capture carbon directly from the air and convert it into value-added products such as food-proteins and biofuels.”

At ValleyDAO, we are a group of academics, entrepreneurs, IP experts, business developers and solarpunks who believe in the power of SynBio technologies as a promising solution to combat climate change.

Why ValleyDAO?

The degree to which the SynBio technologies and know-how can be accessed could soon determine the fate of economies. The pharmaceutical industry, for example, outrageously prices therapeutics and treatments while leaving no room for competition, thanks to their rampant abuse of the traditional patenting system. We need a better system to make sure our medicines, the very food we eat, and access to energy and materials, among other things, do not fall victim to hyper-corporatization in the future. To truly unleash the power of SynBio, we’ll need an innovation ecosystem that fosters collaboration over competition and democratized access over centralized control of IP. Our goal is to create this ecosystem through ValleyDAO.

The ValleyDAO Ecosystem

To create a self-sustaining ecosystem, we’ll need a mechanism for value creation followed by value capture. Our ecosystem accomplishes just that using a three-part system shown below.



1. The researchers submit their project ideas to ValleyDAO and have them funded if they pass the due-diligence process and a community vote. 

2. The IP generated from successful projects is either licensed to the industry or spun out into a startup with the help of ValleyDAO business development team. If appropriate, the IP is also licensed using a pay-what-you-can model for fair and open-source access.

3. Finally, the proceeds, as royalty payments or startup equity, go back into the treasury which enables ValleyDAO to fund new research projects.

It is imperative to mention that ValleyDAO’s assets - IP, equity, licensing revenues, etc. - are ultimately managed by a community of token-holders. This ensures that the decisions involving funding and IP licensing are as democratized as possible.

In other words, ValleyDAO acts as a startup creation studio and as a democratized IP generating engine with a fair pricing model built into it. This ensures that the researchers are rewarded for their efforts and vital SynBio technologies are not gatekept, but are made available to the industry, entrepreneurs, and other researchers who might want to integrate them into their work. An open ecosystem ultimately drives faster adoption and innovation. The open source software industry is a case in point.

Accomplishments and Roadmap
  




Use of Funds
 
All proceeds from the Gitcoin grant will go towards funding the first IP-NFT/research project, which is led by Dr Rodrigo Ledesma-Amaro at Imperial College London. His research group will use the funds to develop an improved platform technology for the sustainable production of fats and oils using microorganisms. The use cases for these products are endless, ranging from palm oil to biofuels.

7473,Portland Regenerative Technology Commons,0,0xc4008D79969697CBe75FB0E0bbfeE43847216822,"PDX Regenerative Tech Commons is building a local coalition of makers to scale bioregion-appropriate technologies for a safe & sane future.

As the regenerative design movement expands, with iterations in community finance, blockchain, agriculture, and material & organizational design, practical local implementation is the logical next step. But the task of scaling these technologies to the level of viable local infrastructure faces major logistical and cultural barriers. Extractive financial mechanisms and institutions that serve their interests still carry mainstream narrative power, holding the mantle of realism and utility with perverse ideologies that are, at their core, irreal and anti-life. We can only respond with reality: as the wealth chase is pushed aside, it's the urgent mandate of an escalating climate crisis that will make resilient and autonomous regional infrastructure a matter of life and death. (It already has.)

Portland Regenerative Technology Commons is doubling down on realism, strategically reframing the language around technology to embrace, as it always should have, the wide range of innovations and strategies that apply systems thinking and emergent properties to the mutual benefit of living systems. For us, any technology that implements these principles is avant garde, whether hi or lo, soil or silicon. Similarly, no matter how apparently sophisticated, we see that the technologies of extraction, surveillance and capture are lo-tech, obsolete, and irreal in their goals. When we demystify internet and distributed ledger technology, or currency and governance models, as design systems that succeed or fail in integrating harmoniously with a variety of life systems, we place them on a flat plane with technologies of soil management and food production. Those that have already made this conceptual move have found rich resonance across design systems, sparking a small renaissance of open source, decentralized and regenerative innovations.

  

Kailash Ecovillage in Southeast Portland

Portland in particular stands out as a hub for this renaissance - for decades we’ve been a stronghold for experiments in open source, adequate technology, mutual aid, alternative food security and permaculture (backyard chicken coops have reached the level of cliche in this town). We’ve been home to visionaries of decentralization and regenerative thinking like Paul Stamets, Viviane Barnett, Linus Torvalds, Ursula Le Guin and Toby Hemenway, and community projects like Kailash Ecovillage (above) and Intersection Repair. Our initial members have connections with local organizations including Depave, Oregon Just Transition Alliance, City Repair, and Friends of Trees, alongside some of the broader existing permaculture, community organizing, and mutual aid communities around the city. As a city, we have the space, resources, and established community organizations to do tech-enhanced bioregionalism the right way.

At Portland Regenerative Technology Commons, we intend to be a community space, work area and event venue for all of these energies, with an emphasis on regenerative and community-oriented finance (including #ReFi, LETS, cooperative and mutual credit models), open design/open hardware, distributed ledger and DAO tech, Ostromian commons management, alternative food supply and urban permaculture. We see these as the core technologies that will be needed to build a decentralized, regenerative bioregional infrastructure that can ensure our community’s safety in the face of crisis and breakdown, while providing another strategic example in localism for the global experiment in degrowth and regeneration.

We have been inspired to this task by the global Regen web3 movement - the Crypto Commons Hub and Regens Unite stand out as examples for some of the first experiments in IRL localized movement building in the space. We also draw  guidance of vision from the local multi-racial coalitions of environmental justice like Oregon Just Transition Alliance and Coalition of Communities of Color. We hope to build a community that can maintain and empower regenerative solutions and projects in Cascadia, including those that have been fighting for decentralization and autonomy decades before the inception of blockchain technology. Our grant will benefit the entire web3 Public Goods ecosystem by continuing the process of localizing this movement, bridging the local-global gap between crypto regens and the many communities fighting for justice and systems resilience, and creating a space where can develop strategies, share knowledge and experiment with adequate community coordination for the 21st century. 



Our Specific Near Term Goals:

Establish the Portland Regenerative Technology Cooperative to provide services for reliable income flow and stage floating meetings as an organizational wing of the commons.

Lease a brick and mortar space on Portland’s Eastside. Our current intention is to sign a year lease with this 1,079 foot flex space in the Mississippi neighborhood of North Portland. The space is open air with a loft and kitchenette, making it perfect for small community gatherings, events and talks while being capable of hosting one or two travelers at a time for lodging. Nearby green space is available in the neighborhood.

Build relationships with and offer our space to a diverse range of community members and builders, including those in broader Cascadia who may want a home base in the city, to share work, discuss strategies, and collaborate.

POCA
Proof of climate and community action

A POCA is like a POAP but for climate and community action.

It  is a reward badge to add to a collection of actions you participated in, whether it is building a community or taking part in a climate action.

It activates and rewards people who are taking action in the current social justice and climate crises, whether it is building, creating, protesting or participating in citizen initiatives. The current economic system rewards those who are destroying the planet.

Can we activate more people to take action in the current climate and social justice crisis? And can we create a mini reward system to thank and incentivize people for doing so? How can we build community among Climate activists, artists, entrepreneurs, public benefit companies, in short, to paraphrase Kevin Owocki in Green Pill podcast #21 on Impact Certificates: 

“How can we create a world in which everyone is creating a positive impact [in our case, Climate Impact] and getting rewarded for doing it?”

Following the example of the POAP, and experiencing the eagerness and motivation it brings to do more work and attend more meetings, we came up with the idea of a POCA … a proof of climate action. 

We can only dream of a network of coffeeshops, local grocery shops, hostels, co-working spaces to start offering discounts to active citizens showing their collection of POCAs, growing the community support by rewarding action.

“People build their collection of POCA’s, as a proof of participation in climate and community action, as part of a global community.”

What will this look like?
Like POAPs, the organiser of an action or initiative creates the POCA, that participants can claim and add to their collection. Registrations would be decentralised, but with a quality check from a rotating team. We can create a peer-to-peer approval of the project registering.

A map or website would show all the different initiatives, all over the world, visualizing the climate and social justice movement, making it possible for people to join existing initiatives and be inspired.

How it is starting
For the GR15 All for Climate issues a POCA with a unique design. All Climate-tagged projects can claim an All For Climate GR15 POCA. This Proof of Climate/Community Action can be combined with other POCAs to show that you’ve created a positive climate impact in the world through various actions. 

We want to build from this idea to create reward system that is not only used in web3, but can create a community amongst all people taking action.

Examples
Fridays for Future organises an action, all activists that feel like claiming a POCA can do this. 
Gitcoin Grants: GR15 issues a POCA with unique design for this round, all tagged participants in projects can claim a POCA
Companies: A company organises a fun event for the climate (e.g. a crowdfunding event for climate, an action to raise awareness, a course, a …
Citizens: local collective of neighbours starts a community garden and creates a POCA 
Ayowecca Uganda organising a weekly tree planting, helpers can claim their POCA’s

Challenges
Can we build this in a way that it is also possible to store POCA’s not using blockchain?
Can we guarantee privacy if needed and wanted (e.g. for rebels getting arrested and wanting to keep their name out of the picture)

7451,CrypMetis DAPP,0,0xdA2B253AeFd1AAC4C6A93c30212950A1635aC5c6,"Overview

CrypMetis is a dApp for managing payment requests,payroll and reporting for DAOs. 

CrypMetis is an additional APP to Gnosis Safe and allows DAO managers to set recurring payments (e.g. salaries), receive payment/refund requests from members, and create an annotated transaction history for approved and/or rejected payments.

DAOs don’t have a reliable process to refund members for out-of-pocket expenses. Blockchain data don’t include metadata and make payment requisitions complicated. Memorizing and executing salary transactions for staff are becoming unmanageable in large scale for DAOs.

CrypMetis has its own flaws but overall, it is a useful bookkeeping software based on Gnosis Safe. Its features that can help DAOs manage their accounting and financial needs are perfecting the financial tooling section. As it matures, CrypMetis and Apps alike, will truly make all payments/transactions in the crypto world more efficient, secure and transparent.

7452,Dottyland Impact Self - Individual on/off-chain impact as on-chain reputation and identity,0,0xB04821C9E7e6A2Bd65C6339C8c20eB1438b5c23B,"Dottyland is building a community of on-chain Impact Selves with the goal of empowering 7.7bln consumers to help halt the climate crisis.

The community will reward its members for off- and on-chain climate-positive actions and turn these into functional and serviceable identities across web3 applications.




🌿 What does this mean?

Think of it this way - each action that an individual takes to either refrain from harming the planet or to improve regeneration has value. Today, however, we are not able to transparently record that value nor its creator and therefore the given value holds low significance in our consumer economies since we cannot utilise it as an asset.
In order for this model to be reversed, our individual impact must become part of our on-chain dynamic and user-controlled identities, aka our Impact Selves. The Impact Self is built on a unique formula deduced impact score. 
We hold the hypothesis that the better your impact score, the better your credit behaviour. A parallel for this is a modern version of your credit score (but owned and controlled by you) that will enable further use cases which set individual climate-positive impact as the quantifier for access, better terms/conditions, higher yield.

🌿🌿 The ultimate success of the Impact Self will be measured in the improvement of the impact score. I.e. individual reduced negative impact and increased positive impact that is incentivised by ever-increasing use cases 🌿🌿


🌿 Where we are today: 

Sept 2022 - we are building a social signalling solution that also serves as user-controlled reputation assessment model as an MVP use-case and expanding the core contributing community during EthOnline for proof of concept. This paves our way towards gathering data for proving the correlation between impact score and credit behaviour.
For the purpose of this proof of concept, we are starting with tracking on-chain carbon token retirement but will be expanding this shortly after to include off-chain consumer dollars to carbon as step 2. 


🌿 Funding from the grants round will allow us to:

-Expand the field of off- and on-chain behavioural impact data input sources/integrations
-Build out the on-chain Impact Self further from the MVP so as to enable more functionality, ecosystem integrations and encourage external use cases (incl. incentivisation models).


🌿 By early 2023 we will:

-Have launched the public minting of Impact Self identity
-Launched public beta of Impact Self social signalling use case serving as user-controlled reputation assessment model
-Built a core contributor community (and associated incentive mechanism) building in the open
-Be in a position to connect the Impact Selves into a self-generating tokenized network


🌿 Lastly, you might ask who the hell do we think we are to be addressing something this insane? 

Dottyland co-founders, Ketly and Kärri met working at a consumer fintech in Tallinn (look it up, it’s the fintech hotspot of the world 😉). Having spent their careers literally incentivising people to buy more, it hit them that they could be using their knowledge for the opposite - to truly incentivise individual climate-positive actions (including buying less) on mass scale. The team has since grown and includes contributors from across web3 and web2 backgrounds (incl token design and modelling, SaaS growth, fintech engineering, dApps, CEX engineering, environmental data analytics and more).


Please do reach out if you have any questions or ideas about what we’re doing or, even better, feel like joining us!

7455,Starknet.id : Identity and naming service on Starknet,0,0x88Ffb774b8583c1C9A2b71b7391861c0Be253993,"Starknet.id aims to be the naming service of starknet, but more than that we aim to be an all in one identity service.


The problems

Digital identity: At the moment, there are no protocol that provides a real digital identity, what we mainly see is domain name and subdomain.

What if we go further ?

Airdrop hunters and bots are now everywhere and it becomes more and more difficult to make the difference between engaged users and well coded bots. This example shows that Web3 protocols and Dapps need a decentralized identity tool to identify and reward their real users. 

Starknet.id solutions

Digital Identity vision : Starknet.id aims to be the naming service of starknet, but it’s not only that. 

The grand vision behind starknet.id is that someday, in a society where web3 has permeated the mainstream, a person’s starknet.id can provide a reliable and comprehensive “digital identity”, in contrast to the unreliable self-issued credentials that we decorate our LinkedIn pages and job resumes with.

Currently we want to focus on the starknet ecosystem, our goal is to build a decentralized identity service that can be used by all the starknet protocols to identify and reward their real users. To be eligible for rewards users only need to mint their free starknet.id that can be linked with all the off-chain services that are generally used in the crypto ecosystem (discord, twitter and github).

Let’s take a use case example : 

The developer bobby.stark contributes to the starknet ecosystem by writing some useful code. 

To reward him the foundation can give him money, but can also give him a SBT (non transferrable NFT) that proves that his work was a success. This SBT could then act as reference on his digital resume.

It works with dev contributions but possibilities are endless :

 Education: Those who cannot afford an expensive university degree can prove their educational credentials through SBTs displayed on their starknet.id and obtained from avenues of informal learning 
 Banking: Loan applicants can prove their trustworthiness through the absence of bad credit history, or by showcasing their good reputation through an SBT collection, removing the need for capital-inefficient overcollaterization models commonly used in DeFi (Upon repayment of the loan, another SBT could be issued as proof of repayment)
 Governance: DAOs can improve their collective decision-making systems by safeguarding against whales (you can’t buy a SBT). DAOs can also avert a tyranny of the majority consensus through a more inclusive voting system design by issuing SBTs to trusted outsiders.

(these examples comes from bankless)






ENS improvements: To prevent homograph attacks (that are possible on ENS), the starknet.id team created our own encoding that permits to be cheaper and to whitelist a certain number of characters. We also think that UX/UI have to be drastically improved. 

We will use account abstraction features permitted by starknet that will allow crypto mobile friendly experience.
2021 adoption was massively driven by collectibles NFTs. We were inspired by their work and we made a cool style where each identity has a unique avatar (easy to share on social media and very visual).

Probably somewhere in Africa or a developing country? We are creating a new program leveraging the existing GoodDollar ecosystem, allowing existing receivers of UBI to donate their funds towards entrepreneurs who create businesses who accept GoodDollars as payment. 

Be part of their journey and follow the stories of crypto entrepreneurs growing their businesses, creating utility for crypto payments, and educating their communities about crypto as part of the process.

All raised funds on GitCoin will go directly to entrepreneurs! (Our team memers will build the required functionality in their free time, or as part of other paid gigs.)

Building an accessible, efficient and transparent financial system starts with challenging some popular beliefs. These include poverty being a personal choice, people not being able to manage their finances, and a job being a sure way out of poverty. GoodDollar has already deployed a free-to-use digital currency (UBI) and we are now encouraging and creating new opportunities to either donate it to entrepreneurs, or support them directly by buying their goods and services.

There are so many creative, talented and skilled individuals in developing countries. People who make a living and run businesses with very little support from authorities and the formal financial sector. From backroom rentals to hair salons and catering, to selling doughnuts or airtime, these are individuals who are true entrepreneurs in every sense of the word. We want to show that crypto can be a way out of poverty and financial repression. By offering a grant available to all entrepreneurs we hope to open up the floodgates to creativity and entrepreneurship, creating even more opportunities for learning and business. 

RoadMap:
1. Discovery and Design - In progress.
2. Entrepreneurs “batch 1” sign up - September
3. Quadratic funding smart contract designed - October
4. Audit complete, Mainnet launch - November
5. Entrepreneurs “batch 1” rewarded - November
6. Monthly cadence of evaluation and quadratic rewards - December

Key Objectives:
1. Grassroots Organization: Organize ambassadors and entrepreneurs themselves to lead the movement at a local level, grounding the work in the local experiences of micro-entrepreneurs and creators.
2. Thought Leadership: Practically illustrate how to create crypto utility on a massive scale through local businesses, onboarding previously disadvantaged groups into Web3 at scale and educate local communities on basic income using stories and evidence generated by the pilot.
3. Charitable giving: Providing a real opportunity to donate to local entrepreneurs in a simple, effective and trustless manner. No need to choose who to give to, as the quadratic formula will take care of that and funds will only go to real businesses providing real utility.

Three user types / Nine use cases: 
a) Entrepreneurs: 1. Sign up to be a part of the program through a typeform. Provide business name, wallet address and basic info. Choose if you want to be public on our website, and if so then also provide some more details like a logotype. 2. Sell goods and services, receive funds into your wallet for a month. 3. The following month you’ll see quadratically matched donations coming into your wallet, no other admin required.

b) Donors: 4. Donate through GitCoin or 5. Transfer funds directly to our payment-splitter smart contract.

c) DAO: 6. At the end of the month evaluate all participating wallets based on how many unique payors and how much value received, then determine quadratic matching percentages. 7. Move funds from GitCoin to the payment-splitter. 8. Adjust the payment-splitter settings for according to the new percentages as determined by quadratic matching formula.

Budget:
Direct cash transfers to entrepreneurs: 100.00% of grants
Design, develop & test, operations, marketing, etc: 0.00% of grants

Monsters and creatures lurk across the Realms Eternum, in search of fresh human blood to feast on and eventually the Lich King will dominate mankind.
 

 
Monsters randomly spawn across the 8,000 Realms
They feast on Troops & Adventurers to grow in strength and power
Valuable Resources are plundered when Monsters win the battle against Troops & Adventurers
Troops & Adventurers gain Morale and Resources when they successfully slay Monsters
Time decay for Monsters during days of inactivity
 
 
Phase 2 Gameplay and Features
 
The battlefield was a scene of utter carnage. Adventurers and troops perished as Monsters pillage their homes and destroy their fortresses.
 

 
Troops & Adventurers can assemble party attacks on Monsters
Monsters group together to raid on Troops & Adventurers
Monsters concoct new Resources to create new dens, hideouts, weaponries and armouries
 
 
Phase 3 Gameplay and Features

The content is there, yet everyday people still have to endure a lot of friction to get involved in crypto and web3. We believe the secret to onboarding doesn't lie solely in better UX, but better pathways to contribution.

That's why we set out to build the simplest possible introduction to crypto. Leaving most of the techy mumbo-jumbo aside and focusing exclusively on the stuff you need to learn to get started.



By encouraging curiosity and giving you the tools to start exploring, we believe our approach can get your uncle/aunt, cousin or sibling signing transactions and minting NFTs in the span of a dinner table conversation.
___

What is Repetition Learning?
What do Duolingo, Brilliant, Codecademy, and hundreds of other learning apps all have in common? They make learning fun and habitual by harnessing repetition learning.
This learning technique seeks to strengthen memory retention by encouraging the learner to re-visit and re-learn the core contents of any lesson. This has been proven to enable lightning fast mastery of any given topic, given the experience is fun enough for the user to keep on coming. We believe we've cracked the code in that aspect.

As we said in our opening line, the content is there. But how often do you come back to a 3-page instructional guide? Repetition learning seeks to break complex topics into bite-sized chunks that can be revisited over and over as needed, allowing for a deeper and more engaged understanding of the lessons.



On top of that, we also took a particular approach to further learning paths for our Candidates. We offer them the very basics they need to know, but also make sure to point them in the right direction with curated sources if they wish to go down their rabbit hole of choice. 

This easy onboarding mechanic aims to nurture the mindset of curiosity that will end up making all of the difference in the long run. By making the initial experience less stressful and more of a leisurely learning path, we can ensure our participants will gain confidence and explore deeper down the web3 ecosystem at their own pace.

___

So, let's get to the good stuff. Allow us to introduce you to the Astronaut Candidate (ASCAN) training, a highly curated and hand crafted onboarding experience that trims the crypto-knowledge fat as much as possible. Average users don't need to know how a platform works at the protocol level, they just need a wallet and some ETH to start participating in our ecosystem.



What's more, we offer them a specific mission to work towards from the get-go, in the shape of their first free NFT, which they'll just need to complete a few lessons to get. By driving their intention and rewarding their curiosity, we'll make sure they know everything they (truly) need to become active participants in web3.

These NFTs will have no monetary value, and will be soul-bound to the candidates’ wallet. We’re not about giving people another reason to speculate, quite the contrary. These tokens will serve the key purpose of data points from which our more ambitious endeavors will spring . As a way of linking up a full entryway into our space, after launch, we’ll be focusing significant efforts on finding and consolidating key partnerships with other beginner-oriented projects.



This may involve special access, ELI5 events with key players in the DeFi, L2, and DAO space; as well as some potential future experiments aimed at demonstrating how web3 is good for much, much more than just the speculatory and financial. Beyond that, the NFT makes for a beautiful memory of the user's first foray into web3.

More than anything we aim to make the entry barrier for web3 as low as possible and make it an enjoyable and positive experience for the user - and also making sure they are safe on their way once they start to venture off into their own communities and projects.

Why go for a Grant?
We’ve been building this course out of sheer passion for the past few months, paying for development out of pocket, and spending long nights tweaking the core experience to offer a truly approachable gateway into crypto. The time has come to scale our idea into what it can truly become, and we would love your support in expanding and realizing this vision to its full potential.

If you’re not in a position to offer your financial support through this grant, we absolutely understand, but there are plenty of ways to help out! We'd be happy to talk about any potential partnerships, and even just a nice DM can help us a lot! 🙂 

We’re looking to grow and develop in the following areas specifically:

Porting the course to a mobile app
Designing our future courses (protocol and platform partnerships)
Community building for web3 newcomers
Social media (looking at you, chief meme officers)
Sybil resistance against course completion by “airdrop farmers”

The core lessons of our project are only the tip of the iceberg, the MVP. We want to eventually extend our infrastructure of easy-to-start “course-lets” (if that’s even a word) to anyone looking to share a complex message in an easy to digest manner. So much of web3 passes unnoticed nowadays just for the lack of a clear way to communicate its value, we can help with that.

Join us in our dream of making web3 accessible to everyone, not through quantity but quality. Even if we end up just helping a single person dive into our space, we'll feel like our mission was successful. We're simple like that: one step at a time.

Ready for Lift-off.

We have already completed all of our lessons and are working on launching the experience for the masses, free of charge, as soon as possible. Just a few nuts and bolts to tighten before the first iteration of ASCAN goes live. 

The core product is already here, we will be launching it soon no matter what. Still, there's still so much to cover for the knowledge resource we plan on eventually becoming, that's where you fit in.

We're looking to expand our curriculum, and include laser-focused pathways into web3, no matter your level of tech literacy. Besides that, we also dream of one day porting our web experience into its own mobile app, to meet our people where they stand.

For now, we're working on two big undertakings in the medium term:

Launching the Course App: ASCAN can only really achieve its full potential if the experience can be felt in a mobile-native way. Our end goal is to build an app that can be accessed from every mobile device in the world, even without an internet connection. This also involves growing our curriculum to include lessons beyond the essentials. Covering topics from decentralized social to L2s.

Creating a Course Builder: As part of that end goal, we also plan to open up access to our platform for interesting projects and protocols in the space. Allowing them to craft their own easy to grasp mini-courses to help us make web3 learning less of a challenge for newcomers. Down the line, the course builder will allow you to explain your complex DeFi protocol or ecosystem in just a few slides, as easily as you'd make a Canva presentation.

The sky's the limit from there. We don't currently plan on launching a token (besides the free NFTs) or establishing any type of DAO structure, we'll let the needs of the project dictate how we scale. For now, we're more than happy to share the news, and full access to the course soon enough, with you.

If this project resonates with you and you know someone who'd appreciate an easy introduction to web3, you'd be doing us an amazing favor by sharing this referral link. We promise to take good care of them.

The problem
The true potential of the knowledge economy remains still untapped. But web3 will unlock this. Content is abundant and growing fast. Think about resources like YouTube, course platforms like Udemy and Coursera and internal solutions like Notion.
The current online knowledge and learning programs, however, are created as standalone resources in proprietary platforms and are not designed to be shared, nor for other humans to be available to provide guidance in an efficient and rewarding way. And they are definitely not designed to be upgradable by a larger audience (Wikipedia style).
Community managers have difficulties creating content and guidance for new roles and keeping up to date with changes in their fields.
A learner can’t customize to their current needs the learning content provided, let alone practice the skills and learn from their mistakes.
Experts and creators are not rewarded correctly, whether the reward is recognition or money. 
 
The solution
Patica is a digital learning platform based on a knowledge graph and focused on personal learning and human guidance, to adapt online education to web3 challenges and today’s needs:
Personal learning is the type of learning where the learner takes responsibility & ownership, creates and curates the learning journey, and defines the definition of success. 
Human guidance is where a human with domain knowledge helps the learning: coach, advisor, assessor, etc. Help with the curation of the learning journey or the assessment of the success of learning.
 
The users
Our target users are not only purpose organizations & their stakeholders (contributors and/or beneficiaries), but also everyone who is willing to learn new skills to reach their own objectives.

Thanks to Patica, Juan created his own tailored learning program, from DAO fundamentals to governance and treasury. He talked to experts on the way and got feedback on his plans to successfully launch the DAO.
He also contributed to enrich and update the knowledge graph, extended his network and connected with other supporting communities.

Imagine Lisa. 
She would like to monetize her long experience in DAOs and tokenomics.
With Patica, she forked an existing program, enriched the knowledge graph with new material and embedded it in her website. A learner, Juan, contacted her with a clear objective. She advised him on best material and shared her experience for a successful DAO.
She had a real impact and got rewarded for her expertise. And Juan and her may want to partner up to work on a new project.
 
Some functionalities 
Content will be presented through a knowledge graph where content will be linked to each other though metadata, most likely relying on OriginTrail Decentralised Knowledge Graph architecture.
On their dashboard, users will have the possibility to create learning paths by linking actions (curated content) and decision boxes (choices to make to progress).
The user-facing part of Patica will eventually have many form factors: 
Web application
Web embedding code
Browser extension
Chat bot > Slack / Discord
Mobile application
 
Go to market strategy
1.     At first, Patica will co-create the initial learning programs with starter communities. These programs will include general and community/expert specific content. 

2.     In parallel, Patica will design and build the stack: front-end and back-end of the first dApp. This will allow users and communities to share, search and fork learning programs from other users and communities. It will also allow them to reach and interact with experts willing to guide learners on these programs. These experts can come from within their community, be invited to participate from outside, or come from other communities.

3.     This is the part that talks to the knowledge graph and handles the transactions, to pay other infrastructure in the network and/or the creators of programs and experts. 


 

Market Potential & roadmap
The global e-learning market was worth USD 215 billion in 2021. It is estimated to reach an expected value of USD 645 billion by 2030 at a CAGR of 13% during the forecast period (2022–2030)
 
Our roadmap is as follows:
Phase 0: White paper and MVP
Phase 1: New & Existing DAOs and communities that see the value of guiding members to learn new skills (onboarding > active DAO members > specific roles (design/develop), such as:
Polkadot EcosystemEco-system

7467,Rebooting Science with Just One Giant Lab (JOGL),0,0xFaF6A887f60b9290df99EE58a3A2F59932b2BB6A,"JOGL is a non-profit, open source, digital and social infrastructure to liberate and decentralize science and innovation by helping communities to thrive. We’ve been a leader in DeSci since 2019, with more than 8000 members, 450 open science projects and 20 communities and 3 major programs (COVID, Cancer and Vaccination) on our platform so far. 

JOGL currently has two main missions: (1) provide a free digital platform for people to connect and collaborate on open science projects and (2) create giant community-driven laboratories that are dedicated to building open source solutions for critical problems (e.g. antimicrobial resistance or plastic waste).




👉 Objectives of this grant:

JOGL has been a web2-based platform since its launch in 2019 and the purpose of this grant is to support the web3fication of the JOGL platform. Our goal is to offer one of the best hubs for DeSci, bridging web2 and web3 Open Science communities.
As we are starting this new journey into web3, we need support from the web3 and DeSci communities. We are initially seeking 10000-30000 dollars to help us create the right dynamic around the project. Ultimately, we estimate that at least 300000 dollars will be needed to transform JOGL into a web3 DeSci machine and even more to achieve our vision of a planet-sized laboratory. 

We also have two other Gitcoin grants running under the DeSci banner: 
A Giant Lab for better diagnostic solutions for neglected diseases
A Giant Lab for better solutions for antibiotic resistance

✨ The vision so far:

Why there is value in bringing JOGL on web3:
Opening the web3 DeSci door to many new people. JOGL will make it easy for its current community (8000+ users + Institutional partners) to create and associate a wallet to their account. 
Making JOGL compatible with the many exciting web3 DeSci tools being built. 
Providing tools to more efficiently capture the value created a given community (DAO model)

🔬 Budget: 

With this grant, we will be able to:
Study how to best bridge web2 and web3 for our users and partners. We will share publicly all our reflexion and conclusions in order to inspire other founders
Fund a team of UX designers and web3 developers that will create the blueprint of JOGL on web3 and implement it
Establish key partnerships with web3 and DeSci actors to build a strong future for JOGL

More details: 

We are building the smartest community on earth and giving it the right resources to develop solutions dedicated to the improvement of our world's well-being. 

JOGL’s modus operandi relies on five essential pillars: 
A scalable digital open source platform capable of connecting very large numbers of stakeholders and fostering collaboration, 
An open and continuous community-based evaluation framework that offers due-diligence services to all initiatives proposed by the community, 
An agile funding model providing fast and additive microfunding (<$10k per microgrant) to initiatives positively evaluated by the community, where applicants are also reviewers, 
The creation of scientific and technological commons to facilitate egoless collaboration and faster information propagation, and
A community animation dynamic that is efficient at fostering collaborations and support among all members of the community.

The JOGL platform is fully open source and free for individuals to use. With 8000+ members from 100+ countries and 450+ projects, it is already one of the most prominent spaces for community-driven science and innovation. After 3 years of development, the beta version currently enables: 
People and organisations to establish a public profile in the space of community science and innovation
People to connect through their common interests, skills, needs and projects. 
Communities to be mobilised around a given problem to solve collectively
The creation and management of communities around a given theme or organisation’s mission. 
The due-diligence of proposals using the collective intelligence of the community

We are currently implementing the following functions: 
Geo-mapping. It will enable the visualization of the physical distribution and location of a given set of objects (members of a community, organisations, laboratories…)
Protocols. Projects will be able to better documentate their work and share their protocols with the rest of the community much more easily. 
Resources. Any organisations or people will be able to declare what resources they currently possess and the ones they could share with a given community or project. 


🌍 Giant Labs:

Giant Labs are the embodiment of the JOGL approach on a specific thematic or problem. They are egoless spaces made to facilitate collaboration between stakeholders and motivated contributors, where resources and funding can be pooled and redistributed asymmetrically as additive microgrants to initiatives positively evaluated by the collective intelligence of its community. Giant Labs have several advantages compared to traditional academic labs or R&D companies. They reduce the cost of prototyping ideas by 10, they produce open knowledge and open source solutions, they are capable of supporting more risky ideas and non-traditional profiles (independants, makers, students…) and they even enable the merging of similar initiatives. It’s not about who comes first but how we go far together.



During our OpenCOVID19 initiative, we funded 36 projects out of 150 proposals using the community review and microgrant approach (120k euros available). 22 functional solutions (diagnostic tests, medical devices, lab hardware, education programs, social science studies…), and 12 scientific papers were produced which makes the JOGL model 10 times more efficient than the traditional academic and R&D models.

Regeneration is an emerging paradigm in web3, motivated by the existential risks of our degenerative economic systems based on extraction, exploitation, and pollution. Global warming, biodiversity loss, and poverty are examples of issues that ReFi and Impact DAOs are addressing. A global movement is rising for the use of web3 for good, but the nascency and decentralized nature of the space prevents innovators from easily knowing and navigating the ecosystem. To cause our individual actions to aggregate to planetary scale regeneration requires intelligent coordination as a network within and across distributed organizations (DAOs). 

To coordinate at a global level, we need a decentralized knowledge network which can enable us to 
Map the ecosystem
Who and what exists? How are they related?  People, groups, media, standards, science, events, jobs, etc.
Spread knowledge
Search and recommendation to provide access to relevant information
Build relationships
Between people, groups, and other resources
 
We’re doing these things already—in discord, telegram, and a growing group of web3 specific organization tools—but lack a holistic map and compass to help us comprehend and navigate the ecosystem we are co-creating. 
  
People may want to learn how to contribute to system change but don't know how. Investors have committed trillions to climate finance but don't see how to distribute it.  By mapping the ecosystem, we create paths for progress.  By allowing for discourse to be embedded in the map, we can build roadmaps for DeSci, investment, engineering, and overarching stories that underlie regenerative cultures. Shared stories can catalyze a critical mass of people, and mobilize the funds, legitimacy, and other resources necessary to make the systems-level changes we so urgently need.
 
So, what are we doing? We are solving an important piece of the coordination stack. We are building a semantic social network- a platform that is designed for you to tell your story and share what people, projects, and other resources you’re connected with. These local perspectives can be linked together to show a big picture view: who and what is in the ecosystem of #ReFi and how is it all connected together? What are people working on?  What is needed? What is being offered? This content can also be used specifically for investors, to provide a clear picture of the value proposition of projects in the space. 
 
The backbone of this platform is a database of knowledge integrated into a graph structure. Knowledge graphs put data in context via linking resources to each other and to semantic metadata to provide a framework for data integration, unification, analytics and sharing. They are already used by the big social networks, search engines, personal AI assistants, markets, and other siloed enterprises that deal with networks.  By integrating data into information, information into knowledge, and knowledge into wisdom, we can create an open knowledge graph for the global network of regerates.
 

 
Knowledge graphs are easy to conceptualize, they are made by connecting nodes representing things (objects, events, ideas, people, projects, etc) with directed edges representing relationships.  This symbolic structure allows for the meaning of the data to be both machine and human readable.  The data can be browsed visually like a map or with a search engine like Google.  Knowledge graphs can be combined with machine learning to improve AI, creating the possibility for humans and machines to work together to cultivate and apply intelligence for regeneration.
 
Here is a visualization of a knowledge graph to give you a better idea:

 
 
A secret sauce to Knowledge Graphs is ontology, the design of schemas for the types of resources and relationships in a domain.  This provides a standard structure for data to be Findable, Accessible, Interoperable, and Re-usable (FAIR). We hope to work with stakeholders across the ecosystem to steward ontologies for various sub-domains, such as DAOs, jobs, and MRV.
 
We’re building this open source. We'll leverage a current prototype that we’ve built for a team at NASA. We’ll build an app with screens for DAOs, founders, job seekers, investors, storytellers, to share and publish information. We'll collaborate with other groups like ReFiDAO on projects such as self sovereign profiles and an impact explorer. We’ll build community on Twitter to promote this platform with the many voices of #ReFi as the world’s innovation force for the future. 

We know that trees can exchange resources through underground fungal networks in a “wood wide web”. Blockchain networks can be seen to allow for value to be exchanged in a similar way for humans.  However, trees also need to communicate through these networks to know how to share resources and coordinate to avoid disasters and flourish as an ecosystem.  We are building a similar intelligence system to complement blockchains. In short, we are building a self organizing collective intelligence platform for planetary scale regeneration. 
 

 
What have we done so far?
We have gathered core contributors including
Ellie Young
Jenn Baez
Darren Zal
Katerina Carbonell
We have been conducting interviews with ReFi projects to inform our first ontology.  If you want to participate in this process, please sign up for an interview or fill out our survey here.
 
How will we use funds from this grant?
We will design and build the knowledge graph as a commons, making it as free, open, and decentralized as possible.
We are also building a public website for interacting with the graph. Here is a simply mockup of how it could look:

7509,Crypto Zone or Country by Self-determination of Peoples by Paraguana DAO Independence Workstream,0,0x0B2843E0fd0Cd38AB867D5328A5878909D701835,"Imagine a decentralized society having crypto and web3 policy supporting freedom and innovation, and arranging a DeFi beach and other crypto venues. This can be achieved by the process of independence with local self-determination (recognized by the regime of Venezuela), which could then provide for the world an example of a societal transition to crypto and its benefits.

Existing sandboxes, economic zones or the like are much subject to legacy rules or the whims of future political leaders (see, e.g., the recent Honduras zone revocation, the Nevada State Legislature’s unwillingness to provide the regulatory framework requested by Blockchains LLC). Ethereum innovators care about maintaining significant rights (free trade, self-custody, renounceable contracts, censorship resistance, anonymity by entities and of beneficial owners, not sanctioning or blocking innocent groups such as Venezuelans or Iranians, etc.), which most Venezuelans already agree with or would recognize in their public policy.

But despite all the ""crypto revolution"" hype, Venezuelans remain bound to a regime that imposes oppression within deteriorated infrastructure. Since 2019, a Law of the Integral System of Cryptoassets heavily restricts operations with crypto, requiring registration with or permission from a Superintendency. Since 2022, transactions that are not in an official currency, including cryptocurrencies other than the Petro, are further taxable. In July 2022, special economic zones were created, but are likewise centrally planned and do not provide confidence of legal security.

The Independence Workstream of Paraguana DAO, thanks to a handful of local activists in the Peninsula of Paraguana in Venezuela (one of the economic zones), has started to collect signatures to declare the Peninsula as an independent crypto zone or country, initially governed by direct democracy of one vote per citizen with decentralized governance tech.

With this grant, the Workstream seeks to conduct crypto advocacy and advance ""good crypto policy and defense of the open web"" in the following manners:

1.Conducting advocacy, awareness, and consultations for this cause at Devcon Bogota (because international support is important). We have proposed to Devcon a community hub for “Decentralized Societies, Network States or Crypto Jurisdictions” in which an activity could be “international assistance sessions” but it was not accepted; with Gitcoin funding, we could do this individually, for Venezuela. We could also outline how the crypto community would see a crypto jurisdiction with good policy out of an independence, fork, or negotiation for sovereignty from an existing state. No expenses would be made for travel or accommodations.

2.Producing a report of efforts undertaken and learnings to date, including interviews with activists and an approximation of community reactions, for the benefit of other activists or supporters who might want to advance similar efforts.

3.Printing propaganda in Spanish on why good crypto policy and defense of the open web is necessary and should be achieved by way of the referendum (see this folder of materials), tracking each material’s impact in terms of signatures obtained. This does not include production or distribution work, which is better to be funded or volunteered locally.

4.Experimenting with paid ads in local outlets (that are not owned by sanctioned persons), with up to 5% of the grant funding, tracking each campaign’s impact in terms of signatures obtained.

The distribution of funds and impact will be tracked as it is deemed viable, considering security and privacy for funds used in Venezuela, and will be reported within three months.",Valid Ethereum Address. 
7555,Allow next 10 million ENS users on-ramp with fiat purchase,0,0x027FB871101a865E0e3440a78aA073BE85763C5B,"【Problems we target】

ENS is now widely recognized as having won the race for being the Web3 identity standard. However, compared with some other Web3 IDs, ENS might still be too difficult for most users who are just starting to understand blockchain and Ethereum transactions. These users are interested in having their ENS name but it will be the first time they actually make a transaction on Ethereum chain. It is likely that their prior exposure to Ethereum is limited “investing” in ETH via a Centralised Exchange. 

The current ENS registration system has some prerequisite that some users will find difficult. They are
(1) Difficulties in acquiring an Ethereum: 
Under certain circumstances there are no ways to get Ether easily. For example in some countries, ETH is hard to purchase with fiat. Some centralised exchanges also take some time to send out ETH to new wallet address as part of a security limitation. Therefore, some users don't even have the ether token required to register an ENS name.
(2) Difficulties in having a wallet：
For a lot of new comers, they even haven’t had their wallet yet, which is a must to hold their ENS names. Also they are not familiar with the usage of the wallet as well as the process of having a wallet. Therefore, this situation becomes a huge entry barrier for users to register an ENS name. There is also a large learning curve to keep your wallet secure. 
(3) Difficulties in understanding the registration process:
Current ENS registration process is not familiar to users who are used to most online apps. Most users are more familiar with a Godaddy or shopping cart process for web2 domains and do not understand why there is a two step process or gas fees or wallets involved. For these users, gas fees are also perplexing as they do not understand why the cost can be different each time.
(4) Difficulties in finding the desired available names: 
Current registration platform only supports users to search names one by one. Also a lot of names are already registered now by squatters. Therefore it is very inconvenient and time consuming for new users to find an available name that fits their demand. 

【Our solution】

We want to solve the above pain points and help more users to have their desired ENS names without hassle.



Our service helps users to buy their ENS domains in 24 hours at a fixed price in USD. We assume the users are familiar with domain or online purchases but this is their first blockchain purchase.
Buy.ensdom.com allows customers to use a familiar process to find, choose and register their chosen ENS names. 

Through our website, users can choose the ENS name they want to register, check out through their own credit card/PayPal and wait for our confirmation email after we’ve actually sent your name on your wallet or in our custody wallet. 



We hope that this will onboard more users into exploring more with Ethereum chain and other dApps.

【Our value for ENS Ecosystem】

We focus on accomplishing the followings for ENS : 
(1) Usability - improving the user experience
Our website comes in very handy for the users because they can purchase their desired .eth names without having to worry about the gas fees nor having a wallet. There is nothing more convenient than actually buying your .eth name in just a few taps using only your credit card. Even people who lack understanding and knowledge about the requirements of purchasing their own ENS name can easily have their own .eth names by using our site. 

(2)Community - growing the ecosystem
By lowering the threshold of users’ having their ENS name, we can let more newcomers join the ENS community, thus growing the whole ecosystem and boosting the community and interest in ENS. It is likely ENS will be their first experience with the blockchain and we hope to welcome them via an easy to understand process.

【Future Development Plan】

With the grant, we can build a better website with a powerful search function to help users find and register available names more easily. 



Our ideal plan is that after users enter and search the name they are interested in, we will provide them with a list of names that looks similar to their searched item and meanwhile show their availability status. After the search, users can directly click into the available name and register the name immediately through our service. 

Thus, people will neither have to worry about having ETH nor the troublesome ENS registration process and bulk research.",Valid Ethereum Address.

https://twitter.com/contessalouise/status/1570043950848933888?s=46&t=wyMaeyjAKS_7McL-2cDTwg

-----
WeSeed is a blockchain-based project working to build a tokenized co-op to give people living in food apartheids in Raleigh, North Carolina consistent access to nutritious foods.

Phase I of WeSeed is a citizen social science project that will be carried out in Raleigh, North Carolina. As a citizen social science project, the study portion of tokenization formation will be led by a social scientist and a research team that will systematically study how community members view their own food needs and resources. 



The research team will tap community knowledge to apply community-informed food solutions. WeSeed will partner with organizations already doing work on the ground, who have wisdom about the community. These partnerships will be key to the WeSeed research team's relationships with the community. The partnerships will be key to the WeSeed team's capacity to collect data that reflect the community's stared needs. These meaningful data will help build a robust, tokenized system around seed banking, gardening and community asset mapping. These assets include the 
food itself, 
critical relationships that give people access to food, 
critical infrastructure that give people access to food and 
rights to decide their own access to food.

This project addresses two major concerns driving regenerative finance projects: biodiversity (in locally grown fruits and vegetables) and social justice (in community-driven solutions for food sovereignty).

By Phase III, WeSeed will have built a tokenized co-op to give people living in food apartheids in Raleigh consistent access to the nutritious foods they want. . 

_____

Phase I of WeSeed lays the foundation for a system of growing, harvesting and purchasing locally grown foods for current and future generations.  

It is important to understand how local families and communities in Raleigh, North Carolina see their relationships to the supply of and demand for food. 

Local organizations, already doing food sovereignty work in the community will put WeSeed in touch with 5 families/meal groups for fact-finding sessions to discover the facts of each family's access to healthy food. These fact-finding meetings will be actual meals with people who live with food Insecurity. 

WeSeed will record these fact-finding sessions, transcribe the recordings and analyze the transcripts for themes about what people believe they need to meet their nutrition needs and what solutions people want for themselves.  

The findings from this phase will support the success of Phases II (strategically developed seed library of Indigenous fruits and vegetables).

Phase III (strategically planted gardens, a co-op for harvested produce and a tokenized community asset map of these gardens). 

The community asset map will be a technology application that hosts a layered Geographical Information Systems (GIS) map. Layers will show: 
Food needs (food and logistics) identified by families
Food solutions (food and logistics) identified by families 
Harvest timelines of existing crops (community has access to) and crops planted through this program
Harvest-to-market transportation 
Grocers and other food vendors 
Schools (science classes) - Data will be made available for science projects
Participating places of worship 
Participating colleges and universities

7534,Rektify AI | Champions of Web3 Security,0,0x827004D559D523912b75dbD4f817000435d81097,"Bio

Rektify AI is an AI-powered Web3 security & risk analytics platform offering attack literacy, vulnerability detection & intrusion prevention for crypto projects & users.

Hacks, scams, and exploits are not nascent to the blockchain space; attacks cause projects and users billions of dollars each year creating opportunities for more ameliorate security solutions. 

Just in the past 2 years, we've lost more than $16 billion in attacks in the blockchain industry, which is projected to double by the year 2026. Both projects and end-users want to protect themselves so we offer suites for both customers. The data portals are intended to be used by end-users to connect their wallets and receive access to risk dashboards. For projects, we offer affordable smart contract auditing and access to our API that stores historical time-series data and on-chain activity pertaining to Web3 attacks.

Recently, we just received more validation from the blockchain industry by winning TRON Grand Hackathon. This global hackathon was comprised of over 2000 teams/devs competing all over the world. We tied in 3rd place for the DeFi category with SlowMist, a blockchain security company that started back in 2018. 

What are we building?

We’re an analytics tool for crypto end-users and an affordable smart contract auditing service for crypto projects. The goal of the data portal (analytics tool) is the track risk metrics associated with certain projects, i.e., doxxed project founders, # of audits, quality of documentation, existence period, chain, roadmap, etc.



The data portal shows displays risk metrics that users would have garnered by doing “DYOR”. But the challenge is, that newcomers and even people who have participated in crypto for a while don't know what they don't know, and more importantly, don't know what specifics to research when discerning project risk. We took an academic and data analytic approach to this issue. We’ve democratized DYOR with a hint of analytics, de-risking users’ investment strategies.

Why will we win?

We’re an analytics platform for crypto end-users and projects; we’re a team of data scientists, DeFi analysts, developers, and cybersecurity specialists that have been in the blockchain industry for over 6 years. Our founder is a data scientist and machine learning engineer who has worked at NASA Goddard, Glenn Research Center, Langley Research Center, and Jet Propulsion Lab throughout college. Post-college, 2021, she worked at Maxar Technologies analyzing adversarial attacks deployed on NLP machine learning models and she worked in DeFi insurance. The ethos for why she began Rektify AI, was to attack the real issue in crypto, which is sifting out bugs in code for project development teams and bringing security tooling and education to end-users, rather than charging crypto users harsh premiums to be insured. Unfortunately, crypto has experienced a plethora of insanity by institutions/protocols orchestrating the same malpractices in traditional finance over and over again, and expecting a different result. This abuse and malpractice is not a secret to subsections of the blockchain industry and legitimate project development teams and their users need protection.

One of our data-driven projects, REAL API, is the largest API of hacks, scams, and exploits in crypto powered by NLP. We showcased it briefly in our TRON Grand Hackathon proposal. Please check it out and like the DevPost link!

What have we figured out so far?

We’ve found product market fit on a small scale with 50+ independent crypto users (NFT collectors, DeFi investors, etc.) waitlisted for our user data portal and global project development teams outsourcing our smart contract auditing service.

Goals

The Gitcoin Grant will help support our development team. We are allocating 20% of the funds for decentralized storage credits, GPU credits, and data analytics subscriptions (Tableau, Rill Data). With the Gitcoin Grant, we will be able to hit our milestones faster so that our project roadmap is on-time. Lastly, this support will go to the development of our MVP showcased above.

You no longer need to go beyond the telegram to find out if the crypt has reached the recipient

Send transaction hash or wallet address and bot will show you transaction status or wallet balance

You will not need explorers separately for each blockchain, because 11 popular blockchains are available in AllScan at once, and dozens more blockchains will be added in the next updates

Now the service shows only the most necessary information. And also gives a link to the explorer, where you can see the details of the transaction or address. But in the near future, the bot will receive new features that give you the full details of any transaction right in the dialogue.

We believe the future of NFTs is about utility, the use cases are continually being explored daily and the NFT space is growing at rapid speed. The problem is that NFT holders are illiquid and they don't always make use of the NFTs they own. Projects with true utility, are struggling to stand out from the crowd among projects with no utility and are more geared towards being an investment. They are looking for more community members to be involved. Non NFT holders feel left out as they can't afford to buy the NFTs or they lack the understanding to invest a lot of capital. 

We are building a solution to solve all 3 problems via rental. NFT rental allows holders to earn rental income, non holders to ' try before they buy ' and projects to have more exposure and community engagement.

It is based in a large, free roam city map, with graphics similar to GTA. Greed's central P2E mechanics evolve around a player-edged casino, backed with a PVP risk-to-earn environment.

Greed's first mint, the apartments, consists of 3333 ownable apartments scattered throughout the map. Within the apartments, players get access to a player-edged casino where they have the edge against the house in the long run. But, in order to deposit their earnings they must leave their apartment &amp; travel to the bank located in the center of the city. Players who do not own an Apartment now have the ability to rob them on the streets, taking a portion of their earnings. Essentially, when a player is killed, a percentage goes to the robber and a percentage goes back into the ecosystem.

Using a proper map layout, player proportions, &amp; percentages we aim to create the first-ever sustainable player-edged casino &amp; a closed P2E ecosystem on the blockchain, all while creating a game of AAA quality.

SmoothDiscovery is a platform for discovering fair,transparent and decentralized token price. It enables everyone to find reasonable token prices and start Batch Auctions to sell ECR-20 tokens effectively and efficiently on Ethereum.

Batch auctions are a fair pricing method that has been battle tested in traditional finance. Some of its uses include everyday Open auction in the NYSE, Direct listings, as well as in IPOs.

How Batch Auctions Work:

1.In batch auctions, the participants are one auctioneer and multiple bidders.
2.The auctioneer determines the auction's sell price and limit price. The sell price is the amount of tokens the auctioneer would like to sell and the limit price is the minimum price they are willing to receive for the asset.
3.Once the auction starts, bidders can participate by placing their bids through limit orders, specifying an amount and a limit price.
4.The auction runs until a certain date.The auction ends after the closing date. No more bids can be placed afterwards.
5.At the auction clearing, the auction settles the final clearing price which is the price where the supply line and demand curve intersect.
6.The clearing-price will be the final clearing price for all participants.
7.The auctioned tokens will be sold at the clearing price to bidders who specified a maximum price in their limit order which is greater than the final clearing price.
8.Bidders who specified a maximum price in their limit order that is less than the final clearing price do not receive the auctioned tokens. But for sure, they can still withdraw their bidding tokens from the auction.

Anyone can utilizee SmoothDiscovery to conduct a token auction subject. SmoothDiscovery or any affiliated entity has no involvement with the auctioneer(s) or the auctions, which are independently organized by the auctioneer(s). SmoothDiscovery is only involved in developing the smart contracts that make the dapp run.",Valid Ethereum Address.

7546,Increasing DEI collaboration in developing decentralized AI by stories_of_ai,0,0x71bD9Cb21a453698fb5a1329b82D56e2bf8E127f,"Proposal
Centralized AI systems do not actively consider community ownership or how to integrate gender, racial or sustainability factors in developing AI models. Researchers have highlighted the harm of AI models that are benchmarked in human-competition, autonomy and centralization [How AI Fails Us: Divya Siddarth, Glen Weyl et al. 2021]. They propose a human-centered vision of developing AI models that complement, cooperate and support society rather than compete with humans. 

We like to propose pluralistic strategies of how to develop decentralized AI organizations. We believe that bringing together diverse communities within web3 and squads would be mutually beneficial to the community.

stories_of_ai’s research highlights that there is surprising a lack of DEI collaboration in AI and Web3 development, the majority of Algovera’s squads are white, male and/or from data-rich countries. We would like to change this.

We like to build bridges so that AI teams can easily form interdisciplinary teams and connect with communities. We envision the co-development of AI models and so that communities will receive returns for their data. Communities need the ability to co-design, get transparency, contribute data, retrain AI models, and get remunerated.

stories_of_ai is a squad in the Algovera ecosystem. Algovera is a community of independent AI teams developing user-centric Web3 AI applications.

Deliverables 
Grant funding will accelerate research and co-design on the 2nd pillar of our Decentralized AI DAO framework called “Community Value Generators: How to achieve sustainable DEI, environmental and commercial value creation.”

Our deliverables are:

About stories_of_ai
stories_of_ai, a squad of Algovera, has developed a human-centered decentralized AI framework (DAID). The DAID framework enables how AI teams and their community can keep ownership of, and monetize their AI model creations. DAID also provides tools and strategies in how to build a decentralized AI DAO that is based on a vision of human cooperation, augmentation, sustainability and DEI.

About Algovera
Algovera is a community of independent AI teams developing user-centric Web3 AI applications. stories_of_ai squad has received one Algovera grant to date for work developing a Decentralized AI DAO framework (DAID).

Motivation
Centralized AI systems do not actively consider community ownership or how to integrate gender, racial or sustainability factors in developing AI models. Researchers have highlighted the harm of AI models that are benchmarked in human-competition, autonomy and centralization [How AI Fails Us: Divya Siddarth, Glen Weyl et al. 2021]. They propose a human-centered vision of developing AI models that complement, cooperate and support society rather than compete with humans. 

We like to propose pluralistic strategies of how to develop decentralized AI organizations. We believe that bringing together diverse communities within web3 and squads would be mutually beneficial to the community.

This is why stories_of_ai has developed a Decentralized AI DAO framework (DAID) which accelerates AI teams with technical tools and strategies that are rooted in interdisciplinary team work, human-centered design, ethics, sustainability and community commercial models.
DAID consists of 4 key areas:

    1    Primary - Design Thinking: who is the user and who is impacted by my AI model?  
    2    Community Value Generators: How to achieve sustainable DEI, environmental and commercial value creation.  
    3    Decentralized AI activities: from data sourcing, storage, training, deploy to publishing AI models to market places.  
    4    DAO activities: covers how to set up a DAO, governance, proposals, treasury management and member protection and monetization of data sets and AI models  

Goals
Our aim is accelerating interdisciplinary teams to push towards the development of AI Web3 projects and DAOs. Our goal is to bring together communities such as everyday people and Black in AI, women in web3/AI, LGBTQIA+ with GnosisDAO, Data Science for All, Ocean Protocol, IPFS and Algovera.

Grant funding will provide research and co-design on the 2nd pillar of our DAI framework “Community Value Generators: How to achieve sustainable DEI, environmental and commercial value creation.”

Fluidspeed is a real-time programmable and streaming payments tool which provides developers and end-users with the ability to pay and be paid in a more convenient and seamless manner than conventional banking. While Fluidspeed can meet a variety of programmable on-chain payment requirements, it is better known for enabling streaming gasless payments.

Core features of the platform include:

Gasless transfers: once you open the payment streams, value is transferred every second without the need to make additional transactions.
No capital lockups: users only need to add capital to their balance in a just-in-time fashion; essentially the smart contract payment will stream until the balance runs out of funds; in order to keep the stream open, you only need to add funds before the balance runs out.
On the Ethereum mainchain: powers full composability for development applications and removes obstacles when withdrawing paid funds like those faced in using Layer 2 scaling solutions or non-Ethereum cryptocurrencies.

As crypto technology advances, payments with cryptocurrency are becoming a competitive advantage when it comes to super convenience and flexibility.Fluidspeed is chartering the water of streaming payments in a variety of use cases.As it develops, we are delighted to see more applications in use in the crypto space.

 The mechanism of action of the project.

	All users of the service are assigned a financial and social rating (depending on the term of the account, blocked funds in the service and evaluations of other users).

	The financial rating is formed on the basis of blocked funds in the service as a guarantee of interest in long-term cooperation and fulfillment of undertaken obligations.

	There are several types of blocked funds:

1. The service temporarily withholds money to increase the financial rating of both performers and customers. 
2. Service keeps money as a guarantor of obligations fulfillment by both sides of the deal (for a contractor as a guarantor of payment, and for a customer as a guarantor of honest and quality deal execution).

	Withdrawal of the blocking is performed in cases and on conditions signed by both parties.

So far in our work outside of the blockchain space, we’ve helped thousands of people get started with their first homes, retain access to their homes and/or lands, and have built several circles through ceremony, creative, healing residencies, and a tiny home community. 

We are now coming together to work across generations and geographies to create a collective resource network – 3Seeds DAO - based on the experiences of diverse community builders, so that anyone can envision their own path to home and community, connect with others, and eventually build themselves with support from the DAO.

With this funding we will be able to advance our two current core initiatives by launching the online community space and starting a pilot project on the first physical community site called Tierrita Grande in South Texas.

Our Current Core Initiatives:

An online community space. We are creating an open-source virtual space for learning and connection. We will first start by hosting a monthly speaker series and continue building out open-source educational modules from our past build experiences, from our current build experience with Tierrita Grande, and from others in our network who are building.

Research, Development & Documentation of low-cost, simple models for systems using Tierrita Grande (or other DAO partners) to test and implement. This will all feed into our open-source knowledge sharing platform we are building (see long-term plans below). We are currently testing systems for water and options for low-cost small dwellings. We have relationships with researchers and alternative builders to start these research pilots and documentation.

Within five years we hope to:

Have a comprehensive, holistic community development ecosystem on-chain to support those who are building models of community in right relationship with the land and her original stewards. This resource network will include human resources (builders, technicians, educators, healers, artists), educational resources, physical resources (products, materials), legal resources, and financial resources (shared purchasing models, sponsorships, and funding pools).

We are excited to work within the blockchain space not just to create the resource network, but also to be able to leverage other models being created within the space. We are especially interested in partnering with those who are creating tokenomics models for land stewardship and with game designers to be able to co-create designs in the metaverse to implement on the physical earth.

Why this model:

Land, home and community are increasingly out of reach for many people. Unfortunately there are very few resources and little funding for those wanting to build outside of the current model that treats land as a commodity and expects a high financial return on investment from development. 

Many people saw the benefit of community during the pandemic, whether that was sharing with neighbors or physically building a community. As community builders ourselves, we had people reach out to us asking for advice on how to create communities on their lands. Rather than a top-down model, we saw the need for an open, knowledge-sharing network where all of us could learn from one another, create educational resources from our unique experiences, leverage our collective power for joint purchasing, and share sponsorships and funding streams.

How our model differs from existing ones in Web3:

We investigated other community and land development models within the blockchain space to see if we might put our network under an existing initiative already well established; however, ours differed significantly from what we saw.

Two DAOs we researched and participated in calls with were Cohere and CityDAO. While we are intrigued by CityDAO’s novel approach to buying land on-chain together and governing the land within their DAO, our communities are not looking to put their lands into the hands of strangers, especially a group where we don’t see many people who look like us. We will, however, continue to follow their progress and learn from their model for co-ownership of land on-chain for our future community projects.
 
Another DAO – Cohere - is building communities and seemed like it could be similar work to ours, yet we found some substantial differences. Cohere designed a community development model first (geared towards one demographic – remote workers/digital nomads), got traditional Wall Street investors on board, and are now looking for lands on which to implement their model. We, on the other hand, have a network of people with lands who are interested in listening to the land first and designing flexible models that work with what the land needs and creating accessible spaces for all ages and all types of contributors (not just those who can work remotely). 

Let's Build Together!

The pandemic led many people to want to create new models for home and community, yet they may lack the resources and/or knowledge to do so. 3Seeds DAO will create an equitable knowledge and resource sharing network network based on the experiences of diverse communities, so that anyone can envision their own path to home and community, connect with others, and eventually build or join others in building.

An online community space. We are creating an open-source virtual space for learning and connection. We will first start by hosting a monthly speaker series and continue building out open-source educational modules from our past build experiences, from our current build experience with Tierrita Grande, and from others in our network who are building.

Research, Development & Documentation of low-cost, simple models for systems using Tierrita Grande (or other DAO partners) to test and implement. This will all feed into our open-source knowledge sharing platform we are building (see long-term plans below). We are currently testing systems for water and options for low-cost small dwellings. We have relationships with researchers and alternative builders to start these research pilots and documentation.

Within five years we hope to:

Have a comprehensive, holistic community development ecosystem on-chain to support those who are building models of community in right relationship with the land and her original stewards. This resource network will include human resources (builders, technicians, educators, healers, artists), educational resources, physical resources (products, materials), legal resources, and financial resources (shared purchasing models, sponsorships, and funding pools).

We are excited to work within the blockchain space not just to create the resource network, but also to be able to leverage other models being created within the space. We are especially interested in partnering with those who are creating tokenomics models for land stewardship and with game designers to be able to co-create designs in the metaverse to implement on the physical earth.

Why this model:

Land, home and community are increasingly out of reach for many people. Unfortunately there are very few resources and little funding for those wanting to build outside of the current model that treats land as a commodity and expects a high financial return on investment from development. 

Many people saw the benefit of community during the pandemic, whether that was sharing with neighbors or physically building a community. As community builders ourselves, we had people reach out to us asking for advice on how to create communities on their lands. Rather than a top-down model, we saw the need for an open, knowledge-sharing network where all of us could learn from one another, create educational resources from our unique experiences, leverage our collective power for joint purchasing, and share sponsorships and funding streams.

How our model differs from existing ones in Web3:

We investigated other community and land development models within the blockchain space to see if we might put our network under an existing initiative already well established; however, ours differed significantly from what we saw.

Two DAOs we researched and participated in calls with were Cohere and CityDAO. While we are intrigued by CityDAO’s novel approach to buying land on-chain together and governing the land within their DAO, our communities are not looking to put their lands into the hands of strangers, especially a group where we don’t see many people who look like us. We will, however, continue to follow their progress and learn from their model for co-ownership of land on-chain for our future community projects.
 
Another DAO – Cohere - is building communities and seemed like it could be similar work to ours, yet we found some substantial differences. Cohere designed a community development model first (geared towards one demographic – remote workers/digital nomads), got traditional Wall Street investors on board, and are now looking for lands on which to implement their model. We, on the other hand, have a network of people with lands who are interested in listening to the land first and designing flexible models that work with what the land needs and creating accessible spaces for all ages and all types of contributors (not just those who can work remotely). 

Let's Build Together!

The pandemic led many people to want to create new models for home and community, yet they may lack the resources and/or knowledge to do so. 3Seeds DAO will create an equitable knowledge and resource sharing network network based on the experiences of diverse communities, so that anyone can envision their own path to home and community, connect with others, and eventually build or join others in building.

7513,THE CASE FOR SUBSTANTIVE FUTURES: ON-CHAIN SMART CERTIFICATIONS FOR ZERO WASTE TECHNOLOGY,0,0x77a78FE8C1a045a3DD148931D7FC40410302e32c,"DECODE, a Zero Waste Fashion Technology company is fighting greenwashing and setting an unprecedented standard in transparent manufacturing, through on-chain smart certifications and automatic metadata capture, all while removing waste from the equation.

DECODE Zero Waste Technology for apparel removes all waste from manufacturing, eliminating the fashion industry's average of 20% waste- which amounts to 60 billion meters of wasted fabric every year. 

While Zero Waste Manufacturing is a very scalable process, it requires exact methods to produce correctly. This is very similar in concept to Champagne vs. Prosecco, or Gucci vs. knockoff. In our proposal, we will address how smart certifications on blockchain will help us scale responsibly through our Zero Waste Certification while fighting greenwashing efforts in the physical world (greenwashing: corporate attempts to capitalize on the demand for 'sustainable' products, while contributing a bare minimum and conflating numbers).

In short, we will do so by auto-capturing physical manufacturing data to establish provenance, leveraging available blockchain protocols & ongoing partnerships with key web3 companies and CNC (computer controlled) machine tech developers.

We will accomplish this using: 

Zero Waste Technology x Certification x Manufacturing metadata x Blockchain protocols 

To:

Develop and implement an open-source smart certification process for physically manufactured goods on-chain.


Throughout this presentation, the following statements will be proven “true.” 

Zero Waste = the future of design
Scaling Zero Waste = removing waste
Automatic metadata capture = verifiable provenance
The Zero Waste process needs protection through certification
Certifications, manufacturing metadata, and blockchain are perfect use cases for each other
Automatic manufacturing metadata is the missing link for end-to-end smart certifications
All of the above are scalable across all industries, not just fashion.


Outline:
1) DECODE Zero Waste Technology
2) Zero Waste Smart Certification
3) Manufacturing metadata collection
4) Blockchain integration
5) Partners/team
6) Conclusion


	1.) DECODE Zero Waste Technology: 

DECODE can be defined as a designer-owned Zero Waste Design & Manufacturing innovation hub based in Brooklyn, NY. Using the tools we have developed for more than a decade, we are set to prove that Zero Waste Design & Manufacturing is a scalable system.

To put it in context, the fashion industry is the second most wasteful worldwide, wasting an average of 20% of fabric that is never used in a garment. Our Zero Waste Technology uses highly complex pattern engineering to accomplish 100% pattern efficiency. This leaves no waste in production; we call this True Zero Waste since we eliminate waste before it even happens. 

Below we will demonstrate how: 

Removing waste while reducing material needed = saving businesses money and saving the planet valuable resources.

For our example, we will use a Zero Waste pattern we developed in collaboration with varsity jacket brand, Settlemiers. This resulted in a cutting-edge limited edition jacket in collaboration with web3 brand Metafactory, using Kong’s innovative v1 halo chips. (p.9-10 in linked document)

Settlemier’s original pattern wastes 24% of fabric. Using our Zero Waste Technology, we successfully removed waste with a pattern suited to using 100% of fabric. 

The best part? On top of removing all waste from this pattern, we were able to manufacture an additional 10 jackets from the same amount of fabric. This incredible efficiency, if we apply this to all garments made worldwide, will have an astoundingly positive impact on the climate, with the added benefit of saving businesses money.

In short, Zero Waste Technology = the future of design

Scaling Zero Waste = removing waste 



	2.) Zero Waste Certification: 

Where the Zero Waste process needs the most safeguarding is at the intersection of design & manufacturing. Design is only a proof of concept if not implemented- and if implemented incorrectly, the process itself is diluted. In the case of Zero Waste, if a Zero Waste Pattern is adjusted or implemented incorrectly, it should not be called Zero Waste. Because of the implied guarantee in the name, we need an open certification process.

Here (p. 12 in our document) is a perfect case of a pattern used incorrectly. Just one part of how it can be used incorrectly, nesting software has not yet been developed to handle truly Zero Waste patterns. Using CLO3D (industry standard for 3D apparel), we find that their nesting software comically misinterprets our already perfectly nested Zero Waste Pattern. 

Given that nesting software is universally used in computerized manufacturing, without first knowing that our patterns are already perfectly nested, it’s more than possible that a facility can cut an entire batch of clothing the wrong way. 

Luckily, there’s a clear path forward.

Including members of ZWDC [Zero WAste Design Collective], of which Danielle is a founding member, we have a foundation already in place for an international certification for all Zero Waste Apparel applications. In being a separate entity from DECODE, this certification will independently employ experts worldwide while connecting designers and manufacturers with those seeking to participate, while certifying & auditing patterns and products as Zero Waste.

In order for this certification to be as user-friendly as possible, and without requiring persistent oversight, automatic smart certifications will need to be employed through smart contracts and blockchain protocols. Luckily, the answer to both comes down to computerized manufacturing equipment. 

Not only does using a CNC machine make it nearly impossible to improperly cut a Zero Waste pattern, but it also provides metadata that, when combined in real-time with blockchain, allows for immediately verified certification signatures.


	3.) Smart certifications through manufacturing metadata:

Alright, on to the meat of the subject: automatic manufacturing metadata capture.

The best analogy to use here is the digital camera.  When a photo is taken, a snapshot of all pertinent information is automatically captured. Location, time, and pertinent data are all stored with the image.  

Simply put, we need this process for manufacturing.

The problem with greenwashing: claims are hard to verify and often conflated
The problem with blockchain metadata: a lot of current metadata is human volunteered, leaving room for misrepresented/incomplete data (greenwashing)


What a smart certification needs: 
	1) pertinent metadata is automatically captured & publicly made available on-chain
	2) this metadata proves “who, what, when, where” and is directly linked to a specific product.

In more specific terms, for a certification to be automatically granted, we need to prove that “this certified operator is cutting this certified pattern on certified equipment, at this location/date/time.” if all marks are met, a certification is issued via blockchain signature, through a dedicated eth address.

Luckily, with CNC-operated machinery, metadata is constantly being generated- it only needs a method of translation.  Combining open-source firmware software such as g-code, and developing a system that outputs readable metadata for blockchain, this project lays the groundwork for all possible CNC-operated applications.

We have paired with Simon Johnson and Shruti Grover from Pattern Project UK, who have built their own CNC fabric cutting table and have developed their own software from scratch for their micro-factory in London, UK. As partners in the development of Zero Waste cutting applications, we will be developing this machine for this intended use, opening the door for unprecedented transparent manufacturing standards.

	4.) Blockchain protocols/process:

Other than simply verifying this metadata, how this metadata is stored and linked to any final product is crucial to maintaining integrity. We plan to do so through currently available protocols/software:

FOAM- a tamper-proof location verification protocol
ARWEAVE- decentralized storage (DSN) for permanent, sustainable data storage
IPFS- interplanetary file system for file sharing
Self-sovereign halo KONG chips- physical NFT NFC chips for permanently linking metadata to physical product
ERS- Ethereum reality service: an on-chain visual launcher for use with kong’s NFC chips
MFO-  Metafactory’s operating system, combining ARWEAVE and IPFS on-chain
Robox NFC chip scanning: transferring ARWEAVE/IPFS data onto physical NFC chips

In a simple visualization, this is what we will be achieving:

Pattern → CNC machine → Automatic product metadata → Blockchain smart certification

In a more detailed overview, it will look like this:

Zero Waste Certified Pattern –[zero knowledge smart contract]→ Zero Waste Certified Manufacturer → Manufacturing metadata captured [FOAM, ARWEAVE, IPFS]→ Smart Certification issued → scanned onto halo chip [MFOS, ROBOX, KONG] → Customer scans chip on phone [ERS]


	5.) Team/partners:

ZWDC: Danielle, Cass, Mylène, Holly- certification acting body

Pattern Project UK: Simon and Shruti- CNC metadata developers

KONG: Self-sovereign NFT chip manufacturer

IYK: Visual software designers for visual interaction through ERS

Metafactory: MFOS and Robox- metadata storage, product linking & Kong chip scanning


	6. Conclusion:

In conclusion, the case for on-chain smart certifications and automatic metadata capture is our best tool in fighting greenwashing and making the greatest impact on our climate.

Join us in building a substantive future.

“Who looks outside dreams; who looks inside awakes.”

-C.G. Jung Letters, Vol. 1: 1906-1950

The Neuroscience of Ethereum is a framework based on First Principles, and it can be applied to advance our understanding of Ethereum. It can also be applied to understand how Neuromodulation is the ""bicycle for the brain"" - stay tuned for the next round. 
 
In web3 and Ethereum, we are endowed with Freedom of Transaction: 



This unlocks coordination possibilities that are, in many ways, beyond the scope of imagination. E.g., we can build a society in which health insurance companies are no longer the gate-keepers of TMS prior authorizations. Our patients no longer have to jump through hoops and holes in order to receive this life-transforming intervention.
 
On Ethereum, we can leverage smart contracts and Elastic Finance (more below) to stream Neuro-Cognitive Liquidity into the Nervous System with Neuromodulation, Transcranial Magnetic Stimulation, and other forms of Non-Invasive Brain Stimulation (NIBS). 




--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Previous updates:

Because Ethereum is a Model of the World, we will consequently glean many insights about our Universe (and Metaverse). Crucially, in-sights about the Nervous System map on to the Ethereum Network with uncanny and striking resemblances. 

One of the most important insights is Elasticity. 

Much like ETH exhibits properties of Moneyness...


...Neurotransmitters, too, function like Money.


However, adjustments to market demand are made by modulating the Supply of Neurotransmitters (Store of Value; left), and not their “Price” – the degree of change induced in the resting membrane potential of the neuron (Unit of Account; right) by excitatory post-synaptic potentials (EPSPs) or inhibitory post-synaptic potentials (IPSPs). Hence, the Nervous System appears to be organized under an Elastic Finance System.

It is imperative we apply these insights towards Elastic Finance.

September is Suicide Prevention Awareness Month. Earlier this year, several people died by suicide following the LUNA debacle. Many others lost their life savings. The implosion rippled far throughout the ecosystem and spared no one, as the market witnessed cascading liquidations sending the price of ETH all the way down to $888. The greed of the few induced the misfortune of many. Without any tools to monitor the cognitive taxes from financial insecurity constraints levied on everyone, we can only guess the degree of aggregate loss to society.

We must do better. Decentralized Finance has transformed many lives, but it is far from perfect. If we are going to successfully build a better world with web3 technology, then we will require a more stable financial system. Thankfully, there are solutions.

Zero Liquidation Loans in Elastic Finance:



By adhering to the Scientific Process, we source Truth from the World. The Ethereum Network and the Nervous System are both Truth sourcing entities. Examined through the lens of Active Inference in Systems Neuroscience, the Ethereum Network and our Neuronal Networks appear to be causally modeling each other:
 


This unfolds as the Nervous System sources Truth from the world continuously in real time, by converting disorder into order; information entropy into certainty. Thus, we can model Ethereum after the Nervous System in this way in order to source Truth from the world, and securely add it to our shared public good – the distributed ledger. Now that Ethereum has scaled with its own Layer 2 solutions, this security can empower us to confidently source Truths and Decentralize Science. Through consensus at unprecedented scale on Ethereum, we can plausibly attempt GameFi solutions: e.g., Sleep 2 Earn to reverse the Sleep Epidemic, or Heal 2 Earn to gamify healthy living, or optimizing cognition with Neuromodulation, or some combination/evolution thereof. All catalyzed by data collection from individuals around the world, and the resultant data token tsunami of liquidity finding its way to Ethereum DeFi. That is one pathway to bootstrapping a human node network.

Below follows a very broad overview of this framework:

7516,Open Source Medical Prize Fund for Retroactive Funding of Public Good Medicines,0,0x1Ab75FEA1f27A6dfAfF81b0371AB6d57E112906B,"Imagine if we can treat depression with an off-patent psychedelic-assisted therapy or cancer with a ketogenic diet? 

Crowd Funded Cures is an Open Source Medical Impact DAO (partnered with VitaDAO, Molecule, PsyDAO, & LabDAO and receiving advisory support from Protocol Labs and the Health Impact Fund), whose mission is to create a financially innovative Impact Market to re-align private incentives in the medical industry away from monopoly-priced patented medicines and towards low-cost, open-source therapies that can treat and potentially cure millions of patients and improve global health and well-being. 

Please note that we have two grants. The one you are reading is our grant application for the Open Source Medical Prize Fund of the Medical Impact DAO, Crowd Funded Cures. We have a separate grant application for our Medical Impact DAO, which you can find here: https://gitcoin.co/grants/7518/medical-impact-dao-to-govern-retroactive-funding-o

Currently, 1000s of otherwise viable unmonopolizable therapies are ignored by the pharmaceutical industry because a monopoly price cannot be enforced. We call them public good medicines because once the treatment protocol is published, it is not possible to stop people accessing the therapy from multiple sources (non-excludable) and use of the treatment protocol does not prevent others from using it (non-rivalrous). 

Unfortunately, this causes a tragedy of the commons which means that pharma companies will not fund the large clinical trials needed for them to be reimbursed by health insurers or obtain regulatory approval. Governments and health insurers also do not want to take on the political risk of paying for large clinical trials in case they fail, which means these treatments will typically not be accepted by the mainstream medical establishment. They include repurposed off-patent generic drugs, supplements, plant medicines, psychedelics, diets, and non-pharmaceutical / lifestyle interventions.

We can solve this tragedy of the commons and provide a high impact use case for society that unlocks billions of dollars in social value for relatively low cost by establishing an Impact Market that incentivises impact investors to fund IP-NFTs representing public good medicines. Successful clinical trial data that validates the safety and efficacy of such public good medicines converts the IP-NFTs into Hypercerts eligible to receive outcome payments from a crowdfunded Open Source Medical Prize Fund proportional to improved patient outcomes validated in clinical trials (see Medical Prize fund figure below). The Impact Market also de-risks the funding of clinical trials for donors / public. The result would be that investors fund new public good medicines that are off-patent, unmonopolizable, and available to the entire global community at low cost, while obtaining a standard return on investment. 

However, in order to bring this open source business model to pharma, we need to crowdfund a source of retroactive (and quadratic) funding of the Impact Market through our Medical Prize Fund. Together, by supporting an Open Source Medical Prize Fund, the community can usher in a new era of medicine which does not ignore otherwise viable therapies because they are not profitable under the traditional patent system. Unlike donations to traditional charities (which often receive the majority of their funding from big pharma), through this novel “pay-for-success” mechanism, you can also be sure that your donations will only fund successful clinical trials.

The following presentation by founder Savva Kerdemelidis at DeSci Berlin hosted by Molecule on 24 May 2022 explains the problem of this tragedy of the commons and how to solve it using ""prize-like"" Pay-For-Success contracts x IP-NFTs to create an impact market for open source medicine:



Medical Prize Fund Key Takeaways

Where's my donation going? 

Your donations will go towards an Open Source Medical Prize Fund. This general fund will provide a source of retroactive (and quadratic) funding of specific Open Source Medical Prizes in specific therapeutic classes e.g. Open Longevity Prize Fund, Open Psychedelic Depression Prize Fund, Open Glioblastoma Prize Fund and others. 

Specific pilot Open Medical Prize Fund categories we are supporting:

Open Longevity Prize Fund: Together with VitaDAO and Lifespan.io, we are supporting the idea of an Open Longevity Prize Fund to incentivise repurposing of generic drug and and other unmonopolizable therapies to improve healthy longevity using a standard functional strength biomarker such as the 30-second chair stand test, which is correlated with healthy longevity. For example, Dr. Stanfield’s Phase 2a proof-of-concept designed to assess the safety, tolerability, feasibility, and trial design of weekly rapamycin (generic drug) + exercise vs. placebo. Our fundraising goal is $10m. 

Open Psychedelic Depression Prize Fund: Together with PsyDAO and The Ketamine Task Force, we are helping raise funding for a clinical trial that will assess the superior efficacy and safety of racemic generic ""Open Ketamine"" for treatment-resistant depression, which costs less than $10 a course vs. esketamine which that is the left-handed molecule of racemic ketamine, and costs approximately $12,000 dollars because it is patented. Ultimately we want to ensure that patients can access safe and affordable generic ketamine treatments by providing an impact market to incentivise successful clinical trials. Our fundraising goal is $10m. 

Open Glioblastoma Prize Fund: Glioblastoma (otherwise known as a brain tumour) is one of the deadliest cancers, with less than 10% chance of survival over 5 years from diagnosis. However, there are many public good therapies that may be more effective than other patented medicines. Crowd Funded Cures want to establish an Open Glioblastoma Prize Fund to support the fundraising efforts of non-profit organisations such as Gillies McIndoe Research Institute which has been very supportive of our mission and is fundraising for a Phase 2 randomised controlled trial to use generic drugs (e.g. ACE inhibitors) to treat glioblastoma. It is also possible that a ketogenic diet may help treat or even cure cancers such as glioblastoma, due to cancer cells requiring 10x more glucose than other cells, and so are starved by a ketogenic diet. Our fundraising goal is $10m. 

Open COVID Prize Fund: The Covid pandemic has killed millions of people and caused trillions of dollars in economic damage. Early in the pandemic, off-patent drugs such as HCQ and ivermectin were promoted as potential treatments and cures, with billions of dollars in public funding spent, but scientists still arguing over efficacy, mainly over political rather than scientific lines. Meanwhile, there are various low cost off-patent treatments like dexamethasone, which have received less attention, but could be effective treatments for Covid and other respiratory illnesses, e.g. fluvoxamine, budesonide, BCG vaccine, L-arginine, and others. 

Future clinical projects in our pipeline:
We actively engage with our DAO, community and external partners to understand where the biggest impact is with public good medicines (e.g. high cost indications such as treating end-stage kidney disease and Crohn’s disease with diet). 

Problem: A Lack of Incentives for the Clinical Development of Public Good Medicines

The pharmaceutical industry’s reliance on patents have led to a massive market failure: affordable and potentially life saving therapies are missing the incentives for robust clinical evaluation and development, ultimately keeping potential cures out of the hands of patients. 

An estimated 7500 generic drugs and 50,000+ nutraceuticals, plant medicines, diets and lifestyle interventions could be studied to treat and potentially cure diseases for 1/100th of the cost and up to 10x faster than patented drugs as their safety profile and often mechanism of actions are known from use over many years. 

However, without monopolistic pricing and/or royalties secured by patent protection, investors are unable to get a return on their investment for the large Phase 2 and Phase 3 clinical trials that identify new therapeutic uses for these treatments, so these treatments have almost zero chance of getting the funding needed to gain regulatory approval and be prescribed by physicians. 

We therefore need new ways to fund these Phase 2 and Phase 3 trials to get these therapeutics to patients.

Solution: Our Medical Prize Fund Incentivizes Phase 2 Randomized Controlled Trials of Public Good Medicines

Gitcoin Grants supports the development of open-source tools by providing direct crowdfunding or “push” incentives. Impact Markets transfer the risk of funding clinical trials to impact investors, by crowdfunding a Medical Prize Fund that acts as a retroactive (and quadratic) funding “pull” incentive to optimize treatment protocols in Phase 2 Randomized Controlled Trials (RCTs) for patients that are off-patent, unmonopolizable, and potentially curative, but ignored by the pharmaceutical industry. RCTs are used to compare the treatment to a placebo or standard of care to determine if the treatment is effective. 

Phase 1 RCTs are to determine safety, and typically not required for public good medicines such as generic drugs, nutraceuticals, plant medicines or diets which have already passed Phase 1 or are generally recognised as safe (GRAS) compounds. 

Phase 2 RCTs are typically more than 100 patients and used to establish efficacy - these are also typically at the highest risk of failure (e.g. 50%). Phase 3 clinical trials assess the safety and efficacy of a therapeutic regimen and are required to get regulatory approval and market access of those therapies, so physicians can prescribe them to patients. These typically comprise more than 1000 patients. 

RCTs must be conducted by independent Contract Research Organizations (CROs) to ensure high quality and exclude manipulation. Regarding costs, a good rule of thumb is around $10k per patient, but can vary by indication (e.g. cancer RCTs might cost $50k or more per patient, due to the requirement of ongoing tests and monitoring). RCT treatment protocols must also be pre-approved by the Medical Impact DAO to ensure ethics approval.

Go-to-Market

Stage 1: Medical Impact DAO crowdfunds Medical “De-Risking” Prize Fund for Retrospective Funding of Phase 2 RCTs (see Figure 1 below)

Step 1. 

The Medical Prize Fund will be supported by crowdfunding and sales of Medical Impact NFTs.

Step 2. 

IP-NFTs are then minted to secure funding from impact investors for Phase 2 RCTs that generate treatment protocols with the most impact, as measured by % improved clinical outcomes vs. standard of care, which will be allocated impact points that determine the right to receive outcome payments from the Medical Impact Fund, through a flexible prize mechanism (e.g. 50% improvement in clinical outcomes vs usual care provides 50 impact points). 

The higher the impact, the more impact points and more proportion of the annual 20% outcome payment received. This incentivizes incremental improvements and medical breakthroughs and “de-risks” Phase 2 RCTs. 

It also means that the Medical Prize Fund is scalable - the larger it is the more RCTs are registered before “market equilibium” is reached. This also ensures the efficient pricing and delivery of impact by the markets.

Treatment protocols that are less efficacious/safe than standard of care will not be rewarded.

Step 3. 

Successful clinical trial data validating safety and efficacy of a certain treatment protocol converts IP-NFTs to Hypercerts which has the right to register to the fund and receive outcome payments for a period of time (e.g 5 years), proportional to Impact Points generated, as validated by an independent contract research organization and multisig oracle. IP-NFTs owners receive exclusivity over their treatment protocol, as long as they are actively conducting the RCT. 


Figure 1. We transfer the risk of funding clinical trials to impact investors, by crowdfunding a Medical Prize Fund that acts as a retroactive (and quadratic) funding “pull” incentive to optimize treatment protocols in Phase 2 Randomized Controlled Trials (RCTs) for patients that are off-patent, unmonopolizable, and potentially curative.

Stage 2: Medical Impact DAO establishes Public Good Pharma Ltd to negotiate Advance Market Commitments (AMCs) for funding Phase 3 RCTs needed for Regulatory Approval of Public Good Medicines (see Figure 2 below)

Once the optimal treatment protocol for Phase 2 RCTs is obtained by the Medical Impact DAO (see Stage 1 above), a Public Good Pharma company owned by the Medical Impact DAO will negotiate Advanced Market Commitments from Payers, e.g., healthcare payers - private and public - government, etc. ensure that funding the Phase 3 RCTs are rewarded with an exclusive commitment to purchase a “branded” therapy, e.g., $100m for Open Ketamine for treatment-resistant depression. The Public Good Pharma company can also leverage method of use / dosing regime patents and reformulations to strengthen its IP position although these would primarily be enforceable against payers but not against doctors and patients (hence the tragedy of the commons) - so open source is ""baked-into"" the model.

AMCs provide financial incentives for Impact Investors to back a Phase 3 RCT which costs around $50m, and also conduct post marketing surveillance to check the therapy’s performance in real life scenarios, to study the long-term risks and benefits of using the therapy and to discover any rare side effects.

The amount of the AMC will be less than the cost savings for Payers that successful treatment protocols derived from these clinical trials provide, which allows the business model to scale. 

As part of the Advanced Market Commitment, Phase 3 RCTs that fail to show efficacy/safety vs. standard of care will not receive a payout from the AMC. 


Figure 2. Our Medical Impact DAO will establish a Public Good Pharma Ltd to negotiate Advance Market Commitments for the funding of Phase 3 RCTs required for regulatory approval of public good medicines.

7518,Medical Impact DAO to Govern Retroactive Funding of Public Good Medicines,0,0x1Ab75FEA1f27A6dfAfF81b0371AB6d57E112906B,"Imagine if we can treat depression with an off-patent psychedelic-assisted therapy or cancer with a ketogenic diet? 

Crowd Funded Cures is an Open Source Medical Impact DAO (partnered with VitaDAO, Molecule, PsyDAO, & LabDAO and receiving advisory support from Protocol Labs and the Health Impact Fund) whose mission is to create a financially innovative Impact Market to re-align private incentives in the medical industry away from monopoly-priced patented medicines and towards low-cost, open-source therapies that can treat and potentially cure millions of patients and improve global health and well-being. 

Please note that we have two grants. The one you are reading is our grant application for the Open Source Medical Impact DAO, Crowd Funded Cures. We have a separate grant application for our Medical Prize Fund, which you can find here: https://gitcoin.co/grants/7516/open-source-medical-prize-fund-for-retroactive-fu

Currently, 1000s of otherwise viable unmonopolizable therapies are ignored by the pharmaceutical industry because a monopoly price cannot be enforced. We call them public good medicines because once the treatment protocol is published, it is not possible to stop people accessing the therapy from multiple sources (non-excludable) and use of the treatment protocol does not prevent others from using it (non-rivalrous). 

Unfortunately, this causes a tragedy of the commons which means that pharma companies will not fund the large clinical trials needed for them to be reimbursed by health insurers or obtain regulatory approval. Governments and health insurers also do not want to take on the political risk of paying for large clinical trials in case they fail, which means these treatments will typically not be accepted by the mainstream medical establishment. They include repurposed off-patent generic drugs, supplements, plant medicines, psychedelics, diets, and non-pharmaceutical / lifestyle interventions.

We can solve this tragedy of the commons and provide a high impact use case for web3 that unlocks billions of dollars in social value for relatively low cost by establishing an Impact Market that incentivises impact investors to fund IP-NFTs representing public good medicines. Successful clinical trial data that validates the safety and efficacy of such public good medicines converts the IP-NFTs into Hypercerts eligible to receive outcome payments from a crowdfunded Open Source Medical Prize Fund proportional to improved patient outcomes validated in clinical trials (see Medical Prize fund figure below). The Impact Market also de-risks the funding of clinical trials for donors / public. The result would be that investors fund new public good medicines that are off-patent, unmonopolizable, and available to the entire global community at low cost, while obtaining a standard return on investment. 

However, in order to bring this open source business model to pharma, we need to crowdfund a source of retroactive (and quadratic) funding of the Impact Market through our Medical Prize Fund, which is governed by our Medical Impact DAO. Together, by supporting our Medical Impact DAO, the community can usher in a new era of medicine which does not ignore otherwise viable therapies because they are not profitable under the traditional patent system. Unlike donations to traditional charities (which often receive the majority of their funding from big pharma), through this novel “pay-for-success” mechanism, you can also be sure that your donations will only fund successful clinical trials.

The following presentation by founder Savva Kerdemelidis at DeSci Berlin hosted by Molecule on 24 May 2022 explains the problem of this tragedy of the commons and how to solve it using ""prize-like"" Pay-For-Success contracts x IP-NFTs to create an impact market for open source medicine:


Your GR15 donations will be used to:

1. Build out the core infrastructure for our Medical Impact DAO, which will govern our Medical Prize Fund, a source of retroactive funding for Phase 2 clinical trials of public good medicines.

2. Support our operating expenses and key contributors to build out the DAO infrastructure and achieve milestones, as described below.

Problem: A Lack of Incentives for the Clinical Development of Public Good Medicines

The pharmaceutical industry’s reliance on patents have led to a massive market failure: affordable and potentially life saving therapies are missing the incentives for robust clinical evaluation and development, ultimately keeping potential cures out of the hands of patients. 

An estimated 7500 generic drugs and 50,000+ nutraceuticals, plant medicines, diets and lifestyle interventions could be studied to treat and potentially cure diseases for 1/100th of the cost and up to 10x faster than patented drugs as their safety profile and often mechanism of actions are known from use over many years. 

However, without monopolistic pricing and/or royalties secured by patent protection, investors are unable to get a return on their investment for the large Phase 2 and Phase 3 clinical trials that identify new therapeutic uses for these treatments, so these treatments have almost zero chance of getting the funding needed to gain regulatory approval and be prescribed by physicians. 

We therefore need new ways to fund these Phase 2 and Phase 3 trials to get these therapeutics to patients.

Solution: Our Medical Prize Fund Incentivizes Phase 2 Randomized Controlled Trials of Public Good Medicines

Gitcoin Grants supports the development of open-source tools by providing direct crowdfunding or “push” incentives. Impact Markets transfer the risk of funding clinical trials to impact investors, by crowdfunding a Medical Prize Fund that acts as a retroactive (and quadratic) funding “pull” incentive to optimize treatment protocols in Phase 2 randomized Controlled Trials (RCTs) for patients that are off-patent, unmonopolizable, and potentially curative, but ignored by the pharmaceutical industry. RCTs are used to compare the treatment to a placebo or standard of care to determine if the treatment is effective. 

Phase 1 RCTs are to determine safety, and typically not required for public good medicines such as generic drugs, nutraceuticals, plant medicines or diets which have already passed Phase 1 or are generally recognised as safe (GRAS) compounds. 

Phase 2 RCTs are typically more than 100 patients and used to establish efficacy - these are also typically at the highest risk of failure (e.g. 50%). 

Phase 3 RCTs assess the safety and efficacy of a therapeutic regimen and are required to get regulatory approval and market access of those therapies, so physicians can prescribe them to patients. These typically comprise more than 1000 patients. 

RCTs must be conducted by independent Contract Research Organisations (CROs) to ensure high quality and exclude manipulation. Regarding costs, a good rule of thumb is around $10k per patient, but can vary by indication (e.g. cancer RCTs might cost $50k or more per patient, due to the requirement of ongoing tests and monitoring). 

RCT treatment protocols must also be pre-approved by the Medical Impact DAO to ensure ethics approval.

Go-To-Market

Stage 1: Medical Impact DAO crowdfunds Medical “De-Risking” Prize Fund for Retrospective Funding of Phase 2 RCTs (see Figure 1 below)

Step 1. 

The Medical Prize Fund will be supported by crowdfunding and sales of Medical Impact NFTs.

Step 2. 

IP-NFTs are then minted to secure funding from impact investors for Phase 2 RCTs that generate treatment protocols with the most impact, as measured by % improved clinical outcomes vs. standard of care, which will be allocated impact points that determine the right to receive outcome payments from the Medical Impact Fund, through a flexible prize mechanism (e.g. 50% improvement in clinical outcomes vs usual care provides 50 impact points). 

The higher the impact, the more impact points and more proportion of the annual 20% outcome payment received. This incentivizes incremental improvements and medical breakthroughs and “de-risks” Phase 2 RCTs and to determine the optimal treatment protocol for a public good medicine. 

It also means that the Medical Prize Fund is scalable - the larger it is the more RCTs are registered before “market equilibium” is reached. This also ensures the efficient pricing and delivery of impact by the markets.

Treatment protocols that are less efficacious/safe than standard of care will not be rewarded.

Step 3. 

Successful clinical trial data validating safety and efficacy of a certain treatment protocol converts IP-NFTs to Hypercerts which has the rights to register to the fund and receive outcome payments for a period of time (e.g 5 years), proportional to Impact Points generated, as validated by an independent contract research organization and multisig oracle. IP-NFTs owners receive exclusivity over their treatment protocol, as long as they are actively conducting the RCT. 


Figure 1. Our Medical Prize Fund  acts as a retroactive (and quadratic) funding “pull” incentive to optimize treatment protocols in Phase 2 Randomized Controlled Trials (RCTs) for public good medicines that are off-patent, unmonopolizable, and potentially curative.

Stage 2: Medical Impact DAO establishes Public Good Pharma Ltd to negotiate Advance Market Commitments (AMCs) for funding Phase 3 RCTs needed for Regulatory Approval of Public Good Medicines (see Figure 2 below)

Once the optimal treatment protocol for Phase 2 RCTs is obtained by the Medical Impact DAO (see Stage 1 above), a Public Good Pharma company owned by the Medical Impact DAO will negotiate Advanced Market Commitments from Payers, e.g., healthcare payers - private and public - government, etc. ensure that funding the Phase 3 RCTs are rewarded with an exclusive commitment to purchase a “branded” therapy, e.g., $100m for Open Ketamine for treatment-resistant depression. The Public Good Pharma company can also leverage method of use / dosing regime patents and reformulations to strengthen its IP position although these would primarily be enforceable against payers but not against doctors and patients (hence the tragedy of the commons) - so open source is ""baked-into"" the model. 

AMCs provide financial incentives for Impact Investors to back a Phase 3 RCT which costs around $50m, and also conduct post marketing surveillance to check the therapy’s performance in real life scenarios, to study the long-term risks and benefits of using the therapy and to discover any rare side effects.

The amount of the AMC will be less than the cost savings for Payers that successful treatment protocols derived from these clinical trials provide, which allows the business model to scale. 

As part of the Advanced Market Commitment, Phase 3 RCTs that fail to show efficacy/safety vs. standard of care will not receive a payout from the AMC. 

Figure 2. Our Medical Impact DAO will establish a Public Good Pharma Ltd to negotiate Advance Market Commitments for the funding of Phase 3 RCTs required for regulatory approval (e.g., FDA, EMA) of public good medicines.

Rouge Ticket makes it easy to create and manage events with Web3. You can distribute or sell in crypto,  NFT tickets for your any kind of events and if you need check-in your attendees with secure QR codes. 

Rouge Ticket is now live on the L2 chain Arbitrum Nova since the 31th August 2022!

Since the app is already functional and live, the best way to understand Rouge Ticket is really to try it!

Launch Rouge Ticket App

Don't be shy and come join us on Discord if you need help, directions, support or even new features. Rouge is a very open community that value collaboration and feedback.

Only one week after our launch, 8638 draft events had been created, 3358 events had been deployed on the Nova chain and 7634 tickets sold or distributed. The application is at the 3rd place of the most used on Arbitrum Nova (source Orbiter L2 data) :





Update on the 21 September, 7700 events have been created on Arbitrum Nova and Rouge is the first protocol on the chain per 24 hour metrics.

The application is fully decentralized: it only uses IPFS and your local device to store data. Rouge ticket is build on top of the Rouge Protocol V2, a blockchain protocol — free and ready to use — to solve the problem of securely transferring social and business credentials.

You can also check our tutorial which illustrated the full front-end workflow to create an event.

The Rouge protocol is a suite of Ethereum smart contracts to manage the distribution, acquisition & redemption of social and business credentials. Each credential takes the form of an NFTs that fully respecting the ERC721 specification. Typical potential use cases of the protocol are ticketing, coupons, vouchers but the protocol is flexible enough to be used with many other types of similar problems.

The protocol is compatible with all EVM blockchains, L1, L2 or sidechains. You can check the current supported networks. As a developer you can interact directly with the smart contracts but most users would prefer using web3 applications.

Check also our documentation website, to get more information as user of the Rouge ticket app or as developer.

Last, yes you can experiment with the app and the protocol, since we support several testnets:

7525,Starksheet: the web3 spreadsheet,0,0xFc7c18A7F0d53A924D6aF07814c47eEf0Fb4F7d7,"Own your business intelligence, and get the full value out of it!

While spreadsheet is the usual goto tool for creating (simple to complex) models (we love spreadsheets), they're like your fav. web2 social network: you eventually don't own the logic you're creating.

Indeed, the complex intrication of data, functions and calls in between cells stays stuck in the proprietary software you're using (Google sheet or Microsoft Excel most probably). Not only is the data stuck, but your capacity to use data or functions from the outer world is dramatically constrained.

At the end of the day, you cannot control the intelligent software you created, you cannot easily migrate it, nor analyze it, etc. It's like if a dev couldn't keep a copy of their code out of the text editor they used to write it, nor could they deploy their program whenever and wherever they wanted!

Starksheet solves this by relying only on on-chain data and functions:
everything that the user generates is stored as NFT owned by the user
every function ever deployed to the blockchain can be used in a cell
no forced migration
no software's built-in features constraint: built-in features are everything available on-chain, with constantly new features added as the ecosystem evolves

Consequently, the model (the knowledge graph) underlying your work in the spreadsheet stays yours, simply yours. This graph can be used anywhere else, simultaneously by several dApps (like in a company, everyone could work on their fav. front end while indeed using and editing the same data).

This graph can also be easily analyzed in real-time by some machine learning algorithms that could:
estimate (human) error impact on each cell (each node) to help you prune useless task and put the effort where it matters
compute sensibility of a given output to corresponding inputs
compare to other graphs (other companies' intelligence) to detect oddities

Quality comes with responsibility

At Starksheet we believe that tools don't replace best practices. In other words you can do a good work with a bad tool and good practices but you cannot expect anything good from an awesome tool with bad practices.

We then think that the best way to achieve data consistency at scale for a company is to make anyone responsible for their (small) chunk of data. Using NFT ownership as a marker of responsibility for this single piece of data/compute lets anyone raise their bar and the quality of the company data lake on the whole. Because everything is linked.

The right interface to democratize blockchain tools

Though the blockchain is a huge shared stated, the end regular-non-geek user of any dApp hasn't realized yet that dApps are just a front-end built by the same team that did the smart contract. In other word, they can interact with the underlying application without using the site, because it's here, on-chain, and so can be used directly.

We actually saw people pledging for a ""etherscan"" skill, meaning they are confident heading to the read/write contract tabs and click in some buttons without (too much) fear.

This is bad and not what we consider a democratized tool. In this spirit, starksheet can also be seen as a 360° revamp of the contract tabs of a block explorer:
a familiar interface to use and create data
just type in the contract name and benefit from a usual auto complete of the available functions
use the output of one call into another one (like A1=token.ownerOf(1), B1=otherToken.balanceOf(A1))
bookmark these calls in a neat dashboard

All together, starksheet aims at being a true general purpose workplace for the common user, not interested especially in web3 but whose adoption is driven by a gain in productivity and privacy.

The Team

Starksheet is actually not only an idea but is live on Starknet mainnet already. The genesis of the idea goes back to mid-may 2022 and we spent 2 months implementing it.

Before this project, we already worked as a team in an on-chain NFT project called The Chain Dreamers (https://chaindreamers.xyz/).

We actually all met in a web agency based in Paris (FR) where:
Clément worked as a Machine Learning Engineer
Georges worked as a Full Stack dev
Jason worked as a Agile Coach/Product manager and later developed the no-code business unit

Roadmap

We successfully launched our PoC on Starknet mainnet in mid-august. You can read here about its usage.
The roadmap now splits into three categories, see also our notion board:

No-code tool: improving the UX of the app
Infra
use L3 scaling
use account abstraction
solve slow RPC providers issue
Generalization
port starksheet to other L2s like Arbitrum, Optimism, Polygon

7527,"Barterchain - bridging the oldest form of trade, into the newest.",0,0xB41F23ba8b912e203aA2FE9de4F831E66E542E0D,"Barterchain is a peer to peer barter platform where members can trade their talents, swap their skills and earn rewards. We’re moving completely away from Fiat - and connecting human gifts with human needs, so that we may all live in greater abundance.

This platform is providing the infrastructure for communities and ecosystems to exchange value - in a transparent, secure, reliable way. It facilitates both inter and intra community bartering - meaning ecosystem members can barter amongst themselves, OR with members of other projects and protocols.
 
The fundamental problem we’re addressing is that so many people in 2022 find themselves cash-poor. They may be time-rich or skill-rich, but being cash-poor means there are so many things they can’t afford. Barter however allows members to outsource tasks, learn new skills, and connect with others authentically, all while saving money. So the benefits range from financial to social, for an individual, household, business or community.
 
Using blockchain technology, tokenization, matchmaking algorithms and machine learning - we’re also enabling users to go beyond the restrictions of traditional barter. We’re solving the age-old problems associated with barter trade, as well as personal problems for our users. Because we truly believe that NOW is the time to bridge the oldest form of trade, into the newest.
 
Throughout history barter has always increased “during times of economic recession and inflation” (Cambridge Press, 1986) and given the current economic climate, we believe global barter is needed more than ever. We’re using blockchain for social and public good, giving members egalitarian access to the services they need, regardless of the economic climate, or their personal financial situation.
 
To fuel this great barter comeback and scale this platform for mass adoption, we’ll need funding - and we want you to be a part of this! Let’s challenge the status quo and bring back barter together - bridging the oldest form of trade into the newest - barter 3.0.",Valid Ethereum Address.

6997,NFA (Non Fungible Address),0,0xe8e5Edb21352509699284eFA94c8c9D815eCDFca,"About NFA: 
Non-Fungible Address (NFA) is an experiment that gives identity to your address as an NFT; each NFT resonates with the Ethereum logo, which means it turns your address into an NFT. (It's a generative Art of your eth address, which looks like the ethereum logo.)

Each address has numbers & alphabet, i.e. it's alphanumeric. We have mapped alphanumeric on the Ethereum logo in such a way that numbers are aligned horizontally (left to right) & alphabets are mapped vertically (top to bottom)

Each address starts from 0x, and lines are mapped on the points starting from 0x. That means each unique address will have a unique NFT. Ultra RARE!

Unique address = Unique NFT = Rarest NFT that you can own.

Why have we created this?
2021 was a great year for the NFT community and the Web3 ecosystem, NFTs were on the top, and pfp was gaining popularity over the globe and building its value in the market. But it's not something that anyone can relate to it. Some people thought of it as a simple png and jpeg file. So, we came up with an NFA as an identity NFT, which represents your address as an NFT, which also looks like an ethereum logo, and it's generated and stored on-chain completely.

It's open source, so anyone can use NFA to build over it.

'Bringing Fusion Power To The People. 
...And The People To Fusion Power.' 

Are you ready for clean, abundant, cheap energy on Planet Earth? 

So are we! 

This is what FrontierDAO is working towards. We believe that fusion energy is the key to clean, abundant, cheap energy for all people on Earth. And we believe that people just like you and me can fund this technology transition to clean energy.

Why does clean, abundant, cheap energy matter? Well, look around you. Climate change, with its droughts, floods and fires, is wreaking havoc on human and wildlife populations, not to mention the planet's ecosystem. 

Imagine a world where even the most remote communities have electricity, heating, sanitation and clean water. This is the promise of nuclear fusion energy (not to be mistaken with nuclear fission). 

Our DAO so far is bootstrapped. We need people power. And we are committed to grow with integrity. This means paying people a fair and equitable salary for the work they do. This grant will go towards paying the salaries of up to 8 full-time DAO staffers. 

I am the co-Founder of FrontierDAO. As a female founder, and someone who grew up on a small Pacific Island, I greatly appreciate the need for clean energy and for people - anyone -  to be able to participate in creating the kind of world they want to live in. 

Democratization of energy is our mission.

At FrontierDAO we catalyze and incubate emerging technology through research, Test & Evaluation and, ultimately, commercialization. Our focus is on the fields of fusion energy, space exploration and science/ technologies that mitigate climate impacts. 

Funding from this grant will be used towards paying the salaries of at least 8 Full-time core DAO contributors (staff). A minimum salary for these advanced skill sets is $50K each.  
The foundational skill areas we need are DevOps, Legal, Operations, Comms/Marketing, Biz Dev & Project Management, Systems Architecting & Community, Web3 & DAO building, Events & PR.

Additional funding will be used towards 
Acquiring RegA status to allow for the widest possible membership and benefits (i.e. not just accredited investors)
Public Awareness campaigns: (Media, Events, Virtual, In-Person, Educational)
For the crypto-Web3  community on What is fusion? And the democratization of energy?
For the scientific/engineering/academic/research communities on how blockchain and Web3 tooling can serve them efficiently and beneficially.


For a long time fusion energy has gotten a 'bad rap.' It's been described as always being '30 years away.' Huge government funded projects such as ITER.org in the South of France, which represents a cooperative consortium of 35 nations, are what most are familiar with in terms of fusion energy research. ITER is 35 nations all contributing funding and brain power to realizing the Holy Grail of nuclear fusion energy. Then there is the MIT spin-off, Common Wealth Fusion Systems in Massachusetts that has gotten $2B in funding so far. 

These examples illustrate why we believe so strongly that #DeSci, decentralized science, is the right approach to have for fusion energy research today. Why? Because by opening up this research to the widest number of collaborators we believe it will catalyze innovation through a competitive, yet collaborative, scientific process. It will also allow for wider sources of funding of this breakthrough technology. 

If a million (or more!) people were given permission to 'invest' in their clean energy future, would they? We believe they would, if given even half the chance.

And now, at Lawrence Livermore National Lab's National Ignition Facility (NIF) in California, an extraordinary breakthrough has been achieved in the past year. The breakthrough is known as Lawson's Criterion.


LAWSON'S CRITERION & SUSTAINABLE NET FUSION ENERGY

Lawson's Criterion is the point at which a fusion reaction becomes self-sustaining. To explain further, the researchers at NIF directed a high-powered laser beam at a capsule of hydrogen and heated it up to 18,000 times the heat of the sun. This hydrogen atom fused and released the equivalent of 10 quadrillion watts of power...or 1.3 megajoules of energy. 

And the even more extraordinary thing is that the researchers have analyzed the data over the course of nearly a year, now, and concluded that the reaction wasn't temporary, but self-sustaining. This means that when the same conditions are met, the fusion reaction will lead to another and then a next and a next in a self-sustaining, self-perpetuating virtuous circle of clean, abundant, cheap energy. 

All of a sudden fusion energy is no longer 30 years away. The most informed analysts now predict that we will be seeing the net energy output of fusion energy as soon as 2024. And from there, commercialization and widescale deployment will follow. 


BIG MONEY ALREADY PILING IN TO FUSION ENERGY STARTUPS 

In July 2022, Chevron and Google each put $100M into a nuclear fusion energy startup. Bill Gates and Jeff Bezos have both backed British Columbia-based General Fusion. Investments in fusion energy soared by $2.8B in the past 12 months alone (as of July 2022 writing). 

That represents a total investment in fusion energy R&D of $4.8B, up from a total of just $2B 12 months ago. Of that total, only $117M is public funding. The rest is private funding by the likes of billionaires and billion $$ corporations. (*These calculations exclude ITER.org Tokamak in Southern France).Congress’s recent Inflation Reduction Act of 2022 spending bill, $370B was included for energy and climate spending.

Of that, only about $270M was earmarked for the fusion energy industry, ‘mostly for construction’ according to the Fusion Industry Association. So, can the everyday retail investor gain exposure to this promising technology? 

No.

At the very least you have to be an accredited investor in order to get in on any of these potential funding rounds. There are no RegCF funding rounds for the everyday investor for fusion energy startups. And none planned so far as we know.

Brief Explanation of Fusion Energy & How It Works 

""Fusion occurs when two light atoms bond together, or fuse, to make a heavier one. As described by Albert Einstein's famous E=mc2 equation: The total mass of the new atom is less than that of the two that formed it; the ""missing"" mass is given off as energy.



Image courtesy Renato Perillo 

The fusion energy industry is projected to be a $40Trillion dollar industry..And some estimates state that it is set to disrupt the $1T per year global energy market; Once breakthrough is achieved at significant levels (referring to when more energy is output than input in a nuclear fusion reactor) this clean, abundant, cheap energy source is set to potentially replace most other sources of energy on the planet. 

There is little to no radioactive waste produced from nuclear fusion energy, either.

:""Nuclear fusion energy is pretty much the opposite of nuclear fission energy.""

As an Impact DAO, FrontierDAO is positioning itself so that its members both help catalyze this race to clean, abundant fusion energy deployment and also share in the potential profits that will inevitably come from it. Imagine if Chevron, Exxon, AramCo or BP were DAOs? 

Clean, abundant, cheap energy for the planet’s people is already a disruptor in itself. Electricity, hot water, internet, mobile phone rechargers, sanitation, cooking, heating for even the most remote communities on our planet is what this will mean. But it doesn’t stop there - issues like fresh water sourcing are also largely solved when the prohibitive energy costs of water desalination become moot when nuclear fusion energy is used as an energy source for the process. 

The closest comparison to a fellow DeSci DAO would be VitaDAO. What Vita is doing for Longevity Research, we aim to do for nuclear fusion energy. We are structuring so that IP that we invest in as a DAO, once commercialized and monetized, will pay back into the DAO Treasury. 

Our purpose is to:

Support nuclear fusion R&D, Test &Evaluation to the point where it’s commercialized and deployed globally.

Help provide the planet a clean, abundant, cheap energy source thus rendering the climate change conversation moot going forward.

Help grow the personal wealth of our DAO membership (open to all) while increasing the DAO’s treasury.The DAO’s treasury will be used to further support innovative technologies and fusion energy deployment. 

FrontierDAO was created in September 2021. As a female co-founder, I helped set up and deploy FrontierDAO on Aragon as a DAO in January 2022. Thus far we are bootstrapped. We are seeking grant funding from Gitcoin for these immediate needs: 

Public information education and awareness with an emphasis on Diversity, Equity & Inclusion. 

At FrontierDAO we face two challenges in our communications strategy:  The scientific, engineering and climate change communities who are our natural target communities tend not to be native crypto or Web3 people. So explaining Web3 and onboarding these communities as DAO members is a steep learning curve and/or point of friction that we must work hard to scale. 

The Web3 and native crypto communities are fully conversant in DAO-speak and DeFi concepts, but there is generally a misconception about Nuclear Fusion energy, often mistaken for Nuclear Fission energy. This, too, poses a steep messaging hurdle to what is otherwise a natural target community. 

Milestone 1

Onboard 1000 members to the DAO who support clean energy and who believe that fusion energy is a potential solution to climate challenges.\Successful onboarding of community will necessitate a full-time core DAO team. We already have necessary DAO tooling in place, or readily deployable, such as Gnosis Safe, Snapshot, and DAO smart contracts enabling governance on our Aragon dashboard, etc. We aim to onboard the first 1000 DAO members in the next 6 months, all committed to supporting fusion energy research and eventual deployment on a global scale. 

Our vision is to scale this to a million or more members as fusion energy builds traction in the coming years. To achieve this, we will require a fully committed core DAO contributor team with requisite skill sets.\

Milestone 2: 

Have the budget to pay 8 full-time DAO contributors who have the required skill sets in DevOps, Legal, Comms, Marketing & Community, Engineering, Science, Project Management, Biz Dev. As we bridge into being an Investment DAO (as well as a Research DAO), we need to remain compliant with SEC and U.S./international investment laws. A part of this intended grant is to be used for legal fees and compliance structuring in a way that allows us to onboard the maximum number of members. The structure we seek will allow the DAO Treasury to pay out to the membership, over the coming decade and longer, shares in any and all of the accrued wealth. 

Milestone 3: 

DAO structuring, tokenization and governance that is fully compliant with US regs. 

In November of 2021, I wrote a paper and published it as a NFT on Mirror.xyz. It is titled, ""Why Science, Why Blockchain, Why A DAO Now?""

This paper was published as a NFT at the very start of the #DeSci trend, but it clearly explains the initial vision for FrontierDAO and how science and innovation can be re-tooled using Web3. We also have our WhitePaper on FrontierDAO.xyz which dives even more deeply into our purpose and mission. 

We aim to democratize clean, abundant, cheap energy. And we want our members to do good for themselves,  their loved ones and offspring while doing good for the planet and its future generations.

7013,Newschain,0,0xE4aa335c804E4c8D5B09711f23d53519c3c48D01,"Newschain is an experimental web3 portal to democratize news publication and distribution. 
 
Democratization
 
We envision a platform where anyone can publish an article, and own it as a digital asset. Current newspapers and social media platforms let you publish content as long as they could profit from its digital asset (a web post or a story), by publishing advertising on it, or by gathering your private information.  
Newschain aims to create an environment where you can publish your content and actually own its digital asset. Hence, profits and responsibilities derived from it would be entirely yours.
 
News Distribution
 
Current newspapers and social media have black box algorithms that select which news are relevant for you. Newspapers rely on this to pursue political or business agendas, while social media aim to maintain engagement and optimize ads revenue. Therefore, a simple question such as “why am I offered these articles?” has no verifiable answer.    
In this sense, our goal is to distribute the news that are relevant for most readers. So, instead of getting the latest news from a centralized entity, each reader runs a transparent algorithm that fetches the articles that were recently most read.     

  
 
Newschain = News in the Blockchain
 
Both democratization and transparent distribution are challenging goals that we experimentally tried to tackle with blockchain technology. In the remainder of the article we will explain how this technology provides some key features that may help achieving the goals, as well as the brand new questions that are brought to the table.   
 
Publishing an article to the Blockchain
 
Modern blockchains, such as Ethereum, provide mechanisms that allow uploading content to the chain different from pure transactions such as “Alice transfers Bob two bitcoins” [1]. We have created a protocol that allows anyone to upload an article (namely formatted text, a location and images links) to an Ethereum blockchain. 
 
Newschain as a system can be thought of as a protocol for uploading news + a browser script to find them. 



Once an article is published through our protocol, anyone with internet access can find the article in its raw version as a blockchain transaction. For instance, the introduction article is actually published as a blockchain transaction… 


 
Why use the blockchain for sharing news?
 
Persistence. Blockchain data structures provide guarantees that once a block is added to the chain, it shouldn’t be erased, at least for a reasonable amount of time. In our scenario, this means that once the article is published it cannot be erased from the chain. 
 
Hosting & Reach. Blockchain nodes are distributed around the globe (or should be) and provide reasonable quality of service to our purposes. If you can make or read the transactions to Ethereum, that means you can read and publish newschain articles.    
 
Proof of intellectual property. Articles are published by ethereum accounts that can prove their authorship with cryptographic mechanisms. 
 
Own your article.  You can think of an article publication transaction as a piece of a server host capacity that you buy permanently. Once you get it, we envision features such as renting your article advertising space, receiving donations directly from your readers, or even selling your article in full. Although these are not present in this first version, we would love to hear your thoughts about it!  


 
Benefits of publishing an article to the Newschain
 
Sharing.  Once an article is published, we immediately assign it an unique identifier that can be used to share the publication using Newschain. Any reader can use it to fetch the contents of the publication in the blockchain and render it locally. A remarkable difference with web2.0 platforms is that ours does not host or hold any information. Newschain can be thought of as a browser that anyone can use to fetch and discover articles.
 
Discovery.  We also provide a home where articles that are most read, by location, are displayed. The intention is that Newschain home works as a news portal with the articles that are loaded in the blockchain. 
 
How does Newchain work?
 
Newschain protocol. 
 
The core of the Newschain lives in the blockchain as a solidity smart contract (repo). There are essentially three mechanisms in this alpha version: The publishing, the gas sharing, and the viewing counting. Essentially, the publishing and gas sharing does pretty much it (register an article and share gas for interacting with the platform), while the viewing counting offers a PoW mechanism to estimate viewership. For technical details please refer to the repository documentation, as it may change rapidly.  
 
Newschain browser (GUI). 
 
The browser is in fact just a script, written in React, that looks up the published articles in the Gorli Ethereum testnet. Hence, no content is hosted by any server (other than ethereum nodes). 
 
Why is it experimental?
 
Being the first web3 platform for open news publication and sharing (to our knowledge). We have several research questions that would like to answer with this first version:
 
To what extent does a web3 platform such as Newschain (that use Blockchain for hosting information) scale? 
What is the performance (render time, load Time, etc) of the platform? How does it fare against a standard web 2.0 platform? In particular, how do different (ethereum) networks fare between each other in terms of performance when rendering Newschain content?  
Does the viewership counting mechanism provide benefits in scalability? (one of its goals). How does it fare against traditional viewership mechanisms reported in web 2.0 approaches?
How does our upgradeability contract mechanism perform in terms of platform stability, and web3 development in general, as we aim to allow contract upgrades as well as gui upgrades, and backwards compatibility.    


What is next?
 
Identity: provide a mechanism (ideally 3rd party) to register an account identity (for ease of author recognition)   
Design article operations protocols (edit, renting advertising, selling, receiving donations) 
Anti bot mechanisms: Design mechanisms to certify human reading of news (captcha, random riddles).   
Gather feedback (from github, gitcoin, etc)
Test IPFS performance for serving Newschain browser script, as well as for content uploading. 
Improve the half-baked GUI and ideally open the source code. 
Test other gas relaying options (e.g sharing a PoS in polygon) 
Explore alternatives to infura gateways (e.g a light geth client) 
Show the user stats in the platform participation (votes, reads, publications)
Show general stats in platform participation (#publications)

6994,Gwei Club: ENS-based personalised Web3 profiles,0,0x7A544Aa8637bC07743e4B7D825d7594EE5262F43,"Gwei Club is a free, open-source platform that allows ENS users to claim and curate their web3 profiles, which display their NFTs, social links, avatar pfp, website, and enables .eth name owners to interact and network with the ENS community.

Why we are building it:

Ethereum is the largest blockchain network today and it’s playing a fundamental role in shaping Web3. The increasingly popular Ethereum Name Service (ENS) is primarily used to map human-readable names to wallet addresses, but it offers so much more — like serving as your Web3 identity. We find the default profile available on .eth.xyz to be fairly basic and a bit underwhelming considering the scope that ENS offers.
We at Gwei Club feel that ENS is the de facto standard for web3 usernames on Ethereum, and our goal is to build on top of this expansive protocol and leverage the full potential of its community. With this in mind, we’re building a platform where people with .eth names can curate their eb3 profiles, discover fellow ENSers, and interact and network with a group of people who share their belief in the Ethereum ecosystem.
A Gwei Club profile fetches data directly from the chain, which means that users don’t have to create profiles, just claim them.

You can do so right now by heading to gweiclub.xyz and entering your .eth name, 
OR
simply search for <your ENS name>.gweiclub.xyz in your browser.


This profile and everything it contains belongs entirely to you. Gwei Club has no control over your data and we don’t ever want to change that. Your Gwei Club profile is decentralized, composable and entirely on-chain. 

Features:

Gwei Club works on both desktop and mobile, and it currently displays an ENS user’s avatar pfp, their NFT collection, social media links and any website linked to their ENS. Verified users will also receive a blue tick badge next to their .eth names. To get verified, a user has to visit their profile and connect the wallet holding their ENS name.




We’re working on adding a ton of new features in the coming days and we’re constantly looking for community feedback to make sure we build for the people who are going to use our product. 

Here are the features currently in development:

> Add 'dark mode' functionality




> Allow users to share profiles




> Give users the option to curate their NFTs in boards according to collections, themes and more categories




> Add an NFT as your ENS avatar pfp and edit text records directly from Gwei Club rather than the ens.domains app




> Enable user actions and connections — users can engage with other profiles (liking, commenting) and add them as connections to grow their network.

💡 Check out this Loom video for a walkthrough of our upcoming features.


How you can contribute beyond funding:

Gwei Club is for the ENS community, and we want you all to be truly involved in the process. If you have any feedback — whether it’s something you like, dislike or features would like to see — or if you want to BUIDL with us, please join our Discord or send us a DM on Twitter. FYI: Gwei Club beta testers and builders are considered to be founding members and will be eligible to mint NFTs from our ‘OG’ collection (dropping soon!)",Valid Ethereum Address.

Unfortunately, today, health data is created, controlled and stored by opaque organizations such as governments and large enterprises. To crack the big challenges in human well-being requires a radically different paradigm of health data infrastructure- one that prioritizes individual data ownership while breaking down silos and enabling open data access and aggregation.

Habitat Health is a peer-to-peer data system, that enables an open, composable yet private health data network. With Habitat Health, we believe we can make health data a collaborative, positive-sum system for all participants.

Progress:
We are currently writing the initial specifications of the Habitat Health Protocol, building on the great work at the Decentralized Identity Foundation on DWNs. In parallel, we are building the initial (open-source) implementation in Dart and testing our protocol.

We plan to release the full specification along with the reference implementations in 4 months time.

Team:
Habitat Health is currently being built with ❤️ by the team at Happily Ever After. Eventually, we expect Habitat Health to have its own ecosystem, branding and open source community!

6969,OZKi,0,0xe5c1A2E0d5d578395BBDaE631cabCcF82EFbbAF6,"OZKi is a MICS Capstone Project focused on users' privacy protection. At the highest view, it aims to help web developers to protect the privacy of web users. The main problem OZKi is trying to mitigate is the ubiquitous PII leak problems.

OZKi has two main components: the OZKi Toolkit and OZKi Oracle service, which together provide a secure end-to-end proving system. OZKi is based on the Zero Knowledge Proof (ZKP), which is used primarily in the blockchains and Web3 ecosystems. However, OZKi is specifically designed to help Web2 developers to implement privacy-protecting software components with minimal effort and without requiring the need to use a blockchain.

In addition to lowering the bar to access the ZKP technologies, the OZKi framework also brings in real-world external data through the oracle, securely protects the input to proving function, and mitigates the proof replay attacks. OZKi toolkit defines the ProofGenerator and the ProofVerifier typescript classes that webapp developers can use to generate a zk-snark proof on the client running in a browser or nodejs, and to verify the proof on the service side.

OZKi enables the concept of ID-less server design in which the traditional sign-in process is replaced with proof-based authorization flows such that the server does not use or store any PII on its end. The OZKi BOT demo app shows how one can implement proof-based authorization flows such as Proof-of-Payment with PayPal and Proof-of-Login with Google. With the proof of payment flow, the server can reliably verify if the user is a paid customer without knowing anything about the user. With the proof of login flow, the server can determine if the user's email login matches a particular domain without knowing the email address itself. In both scenarios, the user's PII is never sent to the server and is thus wholly protected.

OZKi uses Polygon Iden3's circom language and compiler toolsets for writing the proof functions.

Custom cereal boxes from USboxprinter.com are an excellent way to package and promote your products. They make your product look appealing and different from the rest. The boxes are also very sturdy, so they will keep the product safe. Custom Die Cut Cereal Boxes can be made of a variety of materials, including cardboard or Kraft. The boxes can be custom-designed to fit your needs, including the size, shape, and design. The company that creates them will do their best to create a product that meets your specifications.
Customized Die-Cut Window Boxes are great for companies that sell breakfast cereals, snack foods, and snacks. These cereal boxes are customizable and can feature your logo or business name in an attractive way. They can also be printed with cartoon characters or favorite movie characters. The options are endless with these boxes, but you must remember to make them appealing to adults as well. A good cereal box should not only appeal to kids, but also to adults.
Add Spot UV to Cereal Packaging Boxes for a Better Look and Durability
If you need more space, consider designing a windowed box. This type of custom cereal box will keep the product safe from dirt and moisture, and it will also protect the contents inside from damage. Die-cut window boxes are often laminated and can resist external damages. You can also add spot UV to cereal packaging boxes for a better look and durability. These custom boxes will protect your product and ensure that it stays fresh for as long as possible.
Cereals are in high demand. In the US alone, every second person consumes cereals for breakfast. With increased competition, more brands have come out with new varieties and share shelf space with each other in retail stores. To stand out from the crowd, brands must come up with innovative strategies to differentiate their products from others. Wholesale cereal boxes are an effective way to do this.
Consider Using Glossy Or Foil-Coated Cardboard for Your Cereal Boxes Packaging
If you're looking for a custom cereal box, you should consider using glossy or foil-coated cardboard. Adding a glossy coating can make your product stand out on retail shelves, while a doughnut truck-style box makes it easier for regular customers to recognize your products. Spot-UV is an excellent add-on for small cereal boxes that is not only attractive but protects them from wear and tear.
The first thing to remember about cereal boxes packaging is that they can represent your product in a sea of similar items. It's important to stand out in a sea of cereals and other similar products to catch the eye of your target audience. This is where cereal box custom printing comes in handy. It's a great way to advertise your brand while avoiding common mistakes that others make with packaging. We'll help you create a unique, eye-catching package that will stand out from the crowd!
Printing Should Be Attractive and Satisfying to Your Cereal Box
In order to be successful, cereal box custom printing should be both attractive to the eye and satisfying to the touch. By choosing a custom-designed box, you can increase the likelihood of consumers recognizing your brand and deciding to buy your products. Choose designs that make your box stand out and attract a large audience. Whether it's a colorful box, a classic box, or a unique box with different themes and textures, you can increase sales by incorporating custom-designed packaging.
You can use full-color digital or offset printing to customize your own cereal box. You can use complex artwork and a high-quality stock to attract your target market. And when it comes to pricing, YBY Boxes is one of the best companies to work with. And the quality of the stock used for cereal box custom doesn't matter - their shipping is always free, whether your order is large or small.
Custom Cereal Boxes Are a Great Way to Increase Brand Recognition
Custom cereal boxes from USboxprinter.com are a great way to increase brand recognition and establish a memorable impression. While there are many benefits to getting your logo and name printed on custom boxes, the most important goal is brand recognition. Cereals are one of the most popular breakfast foods, so your cereal must be memorable to stand out in the crowd. There are many options when it comes to choosing a custom cereal box, but there are a few things to consider before you start the process.

6984,☄️ Watchtower — a reputation protocol for space assets on the decentralised web.,0,0x880Bc95E4082C6Bc8465A787C0EE7e873C592647,"🩳 Summary

The Watchtower Protocol is a digital public goods project (stack) creating new legos to bring individual verified on-chain reputation of space assets on to web3. The vision is to help manage the crowded orbits & space debris problem and the effect of climate change on it by creating data curation & risk pricing markets of active (and eventually passive) space assets. The project’s aim is to be a bridge to create a space debris market (similar to carbon offsets markets), eventually governed by the WatchtowerDAO. The first product using Watchtower will be insurance - addressing the problem of illiquidity in the in-orbit space insurance market which has seen underwriters leave the sector since 2020.

💡 About
Problem
At Watchtower we’re aiming to build a regenerative space economic web3 primitive to bring verified reputation for space assets and help manage the problem of human made space debris spanning since the 1950s & crowded orbits for the coming mega-constellations. We’re starting this by building open-source infrastructure to eventually build sustainability focused financial products and enabling the creation of sustainability first space projects. While there are attempts (SDA, Space Sustainability Index, etc.), these aren’t open-source alternatives but rather permissioned. The closest that has come to this, is TinyGS and the Libre Space Foundation with some success with their SatNOGS project.

Why Now
The rise of space launches by Starlink, Keiper, OneWeb and other mega-constellations lead us to over 100,000 satellites in the next five years if not earlier. This creates crowded orbital corridors where satellites we use everyday (location-based services to studying climate science) are in danger of colliding. This can be equivalent to if not worse than the garbage patch problem in the Pacific Ocean. In addition to this, the rise in CO2 emissions due to climate change, creates conditions for satellites to “skate on ice” (reduced drag). This CO2 can exacerbate the snowballing effect known as Kessler Syndrome. The rise in geopolitical tensions between the United States, Russia and China have made space a warfighting domain again like the 1950s with increased anti-satellite missile tests (ASAT) creating more junk/debris in our orbital corridors.

🏗️ What Is Being Built
We’re starting with a globally distributed ground network (DGSN) of tracking nodes on Helium with a proof-of-tracking approach to determining a satellite’s state. This enables us to build Laika, a data aggregator marketplace (NFT marketplace aggregator) at its base. Each tracking node hosts its own NFT marketplace providing access to API-endpoints represented as tracking data NFTs. 



Vision Going Forward
On top of this, are two layers - a data curation and a risk pricing layer (competitive skin-in-the-game crowdsourcing of data curation and risk pricing). The curation layer solves the underlying problem in space debris - data quality of state estimation - by crowdsourcing data fusion techniques to a global team of data engineers/curators. The risk pricing layer solves the next problem - risk of collision- by crowdsourcing probability of collision calculation techniques to a global team of data scientists. These are currently napkin designs & associated mechanisms.

These legos enable us to create reputation profiles for individual space assets that can be used in a myriad of financial applications such as in-orbit insurance as one example. It both enables sustainable products in the present but also enables sustainable ecosystems going forward to the future. The aim is to drive capital to environmentally-positive projects by unlocking space debris as an asset class and building block within web3 ☄️🌱.




Watchtower started out as a risk-pricing marketplace to address inaccuracy in pricing risk of collisions but has gone through multiple pivots after stakeholder interviews, to address not only that but the underlying issue of data quality. The Watchtower stack comprises of:

Laika: Its purpose is to create a 3-sided data market (consumers, publishers & market makers) to bring efficient pricing via a free markets approach. Tracking nodes publish data to Laika. The curation layer crowd sources data fusion techniques of tracking data. This layer helps ensure data quality of satellite state estimation.
Dora: a risk pricing layer with the sole purpose of calculating the probability of collision (Pc) metric for space assets. Dora’s purpose is to crowdsource composable risk models. 
Watchtower Libraries: Outputs from Laika and Dora help build sustainability focused reputation profiles for individual space assets. Merging these outputs with the data from the spacecraft registry (the Registration Convention) help us create a complete near real-time profile for individual space assets that can access web3 products. This may include but not limited to:
Verifiable location credentials, ensuring quality state estimates.
Verifiable mutable and composable (both current & historical data) risk models, so data is user-controlled, cryptographically secure, censorship-resistant.
Verifiable reputation registries - smart-contract based registries of space object data which include ownership, Pc, state and more.

🌄Current State
At its current state, Watchtower is sourcing advice from ground station & radar technicians to perform a feasibility on cost, sourcing & logistics with the end goal of building a minimal prototype of a tracking node integrated with a NFT marketplace on top of helium. Our EOY goal includes building this prototype. After which a redeemable NFT program will be launched to purchase and its proceeds fund the mining program, for the nodes.

7063,Nomis,0,0xD587404cd28Bf4eE059ac84a6B7C0219d05EA6CF,"Problem 
We build Nomis to crush two of the most significant barriers to entry- and adoption- of the whole DeFi lending which are over-collateralization and lack of reputation-based terms. Today mainstream borrowers are either not using DeFi lending due to its unattractiveness comparing to TradFi lending, or taking over-collateralized loans with unfair collateral, APR and liquidation terms. 

In other words, today's DeFi loans suck:

• >125% collateral scares away mainstream borrowers from DeFi loans;
• Collateral liquidation terms are often tricky and make DeFi loans even more unattractive;
• There are no personalized terms even if a user has 'good' or 'fair' on-chain reputation. 

Banks, in their turn, overcomes this problem by hiring credit scores. Such tool could also be implemented in DeFi making crypto loans more accessible for fair users and underserved populations, cultivating trust and reputation culture. Moreover, credit score negatively impact the number of crypto fraud cases by disincentivizing actors to play dirty. 


Solution
Nomis is an open-source protocol which helps on-chain developers both to build better DeFi products and use cases, and to balance already existing high-TVL protocols. Every lending/borrowing platform will be able to provide its end-users with extremely customized loan terms for borrowers by using Nomis API. 

Nomis is designed to be a multi/cross-chain solution to offer the most robust financial snapshot of a potential borrower by hiring hierarchy analysis as a scoring method.

Nomis helps blockchains and/or protocols to grow its TVL, MAU (as a result of acquisition of mainstream borrowers), MAD, # of on-chain use cases (as a result of opportunity provided to develop new DeFi solutions on-top of the Nomis open-source protocol).


Differentiation
Nomis' competitors are other credit scores such as Chainscore (NEAR), RociFi (Polygon), Spectral Finance (Ethereum), Project Galaxy, Cred Protocol, and TrueFi, etc. 

Nomis, in its turn, brings 2 crucial competitive advantages to the table: 
1. Nomis is an open-source solution that helps web3 developers leverage credit scores building better on-chain products and communities.
2. Nomis offers the most robust financial snapshot of a potential borrower by hiring multi-chain approach and hierarchy analysis as a scoring method. 


What's next for Nomis
As mentioned above, our goal is to allow one to borrow capital using one's on-chain reputation as a form of collateral (best case scenario), or at least provide better terms. Although, the long-term vision for Nomis goes far beyond credit scoring for DeFi: other dApps will be able to use existing Nomis Scores as well as building their own custom scores for any need (e.g. wallet qualifier for jobs applications, whitelists, special offerings for products, or just for inviting to a private party, etc.). In other words, our big-picture vision includes building the credential and identity infrastructure layer and empowering developers to build on top of it.

What Is ReFi
Our environment provides many benefits to humans (such as clean air, water, and productive soil), these are called Ecosystem Services. The quantity of natural assets which provide these ecosystem services (such as geology, soil, air, water, and biomass) are referred to as Natural Capital. By putting a numeric value on ecosystem services and natural capital, market-based pricing and coordination mechanisms can be used to determine the monetary value of them. Regenerative Finance (ReFi) is the process of using various forms of capital to drive systematic, sustainable, and positive change for all stakeholders. It leverages natural capital currencies and other tokenized assets for the preservation of life and ecological health. Internalizing the externalities and realizing the true value of these assets can allow us to preserve and regenerate the biosphere. Allowing us to escape a system of exploitation leading towards scarcity, and instead creating new systems that function in regeneration leading towards abundance. The most commonly known ReFi token used currently, is carbon credits. 
Carbon Credits
There are main types of carbon credits: carbon avoidance, emission reduction and carbon dioxide removal. Carbon avoidance is when an organization is paid to not do an action that would produce CO2, such as cutting down a forest. This is the most common carbon credit type. This is often classified under the emission reduction credit. These credits are produced when an entity reduces the emissions they were originally producing. Carbon dioxide removal is the second type of carbon credit. Carbon removal is when an organization is paid to do an action that would remove CO2 from our atmosphere, like planting a forest. Both types of credits must have their actions go through a measurement, reporting and verification (MRV) process by a third party. When purchasing credits entities typically go through a marketplace with intermediaries connecting the producer of credits and buyers. One such intermediary is Verra, which Toucan uses to bridge their credits onto the blockchain.
Broadening Scope
If carbon credits were used to offset all CO2 impacts without addressing other ecosystem services (such as biodiversity, soil quality) and social rights, we would have failed in building systems that align with the preservation and the regeneration of the biosphere. Properly designing carbon credits and other types of credits can lead to co-benefits of these other ecosystem services. MRV of these ecosystem services and social rights is difficult, as well as properly valuing them. However, organizations are already creating MRV methodologies that can be utilized (such as Regen Network, BasinDAO, and Avano). 
MRV Intro
MRV consists of three distinct features, all of which are vital to conveying legitimacy of regenerative projects (such as tree planting) to stakeholders. Monitoring is the process of measuring the total ecosystem and social services provided by the project. When measuring data is collected through satellite, IOT, georeferenced imagery from boots on the ground, as well as surveys. Reporting involves describing the methodologies that were used to collect and analyze the data, as well as potential biases and any assumptions that went into the data collection. Verification refers to the review process involving a third party that was utilized to ensure the validity of the uploaded data and methodologies.  
Problem
There are a few centralized methodologies that exist for creating credits, however few regenerative projects have the financial resources to implement or comply with them. If they do, the third parties that provide these MRV methods utilize them infrequently with little or no personal connection to the area they are monitoring. With the MRV methods currently utilized there are gaps in information, and the data backing these projects can vary significantly in precision, magnitude, and quality. Through centralization, projects are siloed and left to stand on their own. Meanwhile, overly high transaction costs to utilize existing MRV methodologies limits participation from the many decentralized projects doing regenerative action (ie. soil carbon). Without proof that they have been able to complete accreditation through the methodologies, these projects find it difficult for funders to provide them with capital. This especially impacts marginalized communities. Without coordination and cooperation with MRV, it will be difficult for regenerative projects to scale.
Solution
Decentralized measurement, reporting and verification (dMRV) means that no single entity will own, manage or regulate how MRV is done. Instead a collective of people from many different organizations can build upon and improve this dMRV system. For current accreditation standards a combination of on the ground data collection, satellite sensing and IOT devices are used to back the credits. Utilizing web3 mentality, trust minimized data collection methods can be created. An example of this is to write open codes for actions that used to be performed by humans, like detecting a tree and the species of tree it is. Other data collection technologies can become integrated into this system as they become standard in the future. 
Once the data is collected open source reporting and verification methodologies can be utilized to analyze the data. Entities that collect the data and create the analysis methodologies are paid each time data is used and an analysis done. This inspires entrepreneurs to build specialized dMRV services which can benefit further regenerative projects. The entire dMRV allows for standardization, trustlessness, immutability, transparency, and open accessibility. This paves the way for decentralized data backed credits. These credits are tied to a specific regenerative action and entity who carried out the action continuously updated over time as more data is gathered. This data and the methodologies used to analyze it is stored permanently and immutably through technology such as IPFS, Arweave etc. The collectors of this data are the owners of it, allowing for sensitive data to be fully controlled by its owner. The dMRV would assist regenerative projects across blockchains and be interoperable with any new blockchain that came into existence. Every entity that is involved with this dMRV helps to iteratively improve upon it. With this, local communities can become more deeply involved with how the regenerative projects they carry out go through the dMRV process as well as tap into funding that was not previously available to carry out these projects. Along with that the diversity and veracity of Natural Capital assets being valued can exponentially increase. 
We are in the beginning of this dMRV process and countless building blocks are still missing. There will be problems and limitations that we encounter, but as these gradually get addressed it will become possible to use this new set of lego building blocks to build things that we can hardly imagine today. 
What is Needed
Data
In this dMRV everything is open to where there is only one final layer of trust- the data itself. Trust minimized data collection can be done through a combination of remote sensing, IoT, and human sensing (such as with smart-phones). The data collected is stored permanently and immutably through current technology such as IPFS and Arweave. By multiple data sources backing up that a regenerative action has occurred, more accurate calculations can be created. When one of those inputs is inaccurate, the other data sources can openly show a dispute. When a dispute arises, the stakeholders of the dMRV system can confirm or deny the accuracy of the data. Scoring this data for quality, resolution, and temporal frequency can enable any entity utilizing the dMRV to compare the data sources they pay for. Allowing them to quickly choose the best dataset for their needs. Through this, data becomes highly available as many organizations strive to provide the best data for people’s needs. This puts publishers on a level playing field and allows the companies with the best data to naturally succeed. Along with that publishers can not only benefit from the dMRV utilizing the data but other organizations that might want their data (such as parametric insurance). When individuals can decide who gets access to their data, they can ensure it is used ethically. They can also willingly give access to their data to those attempting to create good causes.

Analysis
Reporting and verification utilize algorithms. Algorithms are a set of instructions followed to solve a problem or accomplish a task (types of algorithms include standard, machine learning and AI). They are used to process data or information. For example georeferenced imagery can be analyzed using an algorithm that detects if a tree is present in that imagery. Another example is an algorithm can choose which data sources are the most appropriate for evaluating a regenerative action based upon how these data sources did previously. This is more efficient than a human could do, reducing the dMRV costs. 
Previous MRV organizations have developed their own algorithms. Some of these algorithms are open source and will become part of the dMRV system if there is no conflict with the creators in doing so. Oftentimes it is only the MRV organization that developed the algorithm that uses it. Allowing more entities to utilize the MRV algorithm, “algorithms-as-a-service” have arisen as a business model. Aaas allows entities of very small to large financial backing to benefit from them. For example, a small business might not have the resources to hire a data scientist to build and train a machine learning model or maintain the infrastructure needed to store the data that the model would be trained on. However, with AaaS, they can simply subscribe to a service and use the algorithms that have been created by someone else. Now through decentralization, algorithm providers can offer their services in a trust minimized and automated way. Along with that they can help financially support the providers of the data that was used to train that algorithm, which in turn gives data providers an incentive to provide high-quality and unique data that otherwise wouldn’t be available for training. Algorithmic transparency allows regenerative actions to demonstrate the ecosystem services they provide in a trustless, decentralized and immutable manner. Which in turn will attract more ReFi investors to support these actions. The more funding that gets channeled towards regenerative actions, the more the dMRV system is used and with each iteration it improves. 

Infrastructure 
In order to host the data and distribute money to creators of algorithms, among other components of the dMRV system, decentralized infrastructure needs to be created. To permanently store the data collected, decentralized storage systems need to be utilized. For distributing that data to entities that would like to purchase it, data markets need to adequately display it. A new distributed system needs to be created for analyzing that data and paying for each time an analysis methodology is utilized. Some of these systems exist, however they can be improved upon to further support the dMRV system. 

Revenue Sources
This dMRV system will be created bottom up from individuals and software, these individuals are who we aim to get rewarded through this software system. The flow of this system is planned to be as follows. An entity pays for collection of data, entities affiliated with this dMRV system collect the data using techniques that are part of this system. The data goes to decentralized storage which is paid for, then the entity that pays for the data is able to access it. The data is interpreted via methodologies either that the entity has proprietary control over or that is open source and part of the dMRV system. If the method is open source, a donation is channeled to the creators of the method for its use. The collected data is also marketed in a data marketplace, when people use the data they pay for the use of it. This payment goes towards both the marketplace and the data creator.

Cross Organizational Support
Behind all of this are people. These people have formed their own decentralized organizations specializing in different aspects of the dMRV system. There are organizations specializing in data collection, analysis and domain experts. The organizations participating in the dMRV will continue to expand as the system builds continued support. 

Map Link

Data Collectors 
Trust minimized data collection can be done through a combination of remote sensing, IoT, and human sensing (such as with smart-phones). These are the organizations that are currently the most prevalent in the web3 space doing work collecting data in each of these areas.

Satellite- Shamba
The first company to launch a specialized geospatial oracle on the Chainlink network. They have extensive experience in web2 geospatial and information technology and are continuously innovating and pushing the boundaries of these spaces for web3. They have a focus on creating real world applications for this data. 

Drone- VillageGrid
Focused on finding web3 solutions for existing rural electrification projects, VillageGrid is using drone produced GeoTIFFs as NFTs to capture before-and-after progress updates of rural solar farms, and then exploring blockchain-based energy metering systems to improve the current billing services for said solar farms.

Edge & IOT - Athena Protocol
Specializing in the deployment of edge computation networks, uncertainty accounting , and the development implementation of algorithmic fairness frameworks. 
On-boarding & human-sensing - Eco Labs / TIA (The Impact App)
A collaborative on-boarding ecosystem for regenerative action. Eco Labs is developing TIA, an app that will function as a how-to guide for using dMRV services in ReFi, a human-sensing tool to collect images / video from regenerators to be used in Eco Credit methodologies for Regen Network, issue an ID associated with projects, and facilitate payments via Celo integration.

Human Sensing- ORGO 
A simplified structure or system for recruiting volunteers, collecting data, managing workflows, and rewarding contributors.

Data Analysis
Once the data has been collected it needs to be cleaned and further analyzed. These are the organizations creating methodologies for this. 

Astral
Promoting the evolution of an open, human-centered and composable location-based decentralized web. They have created specialized data storage systems, data registries, and a suite of geometric and topological analysis methodologies in Solidity. 

Algovera 
A cooperative of people working to develop useful AI apps. Currently in the process of building systems for rewarding algorithm creators for each time their algorithm is used. 

Infrastructure
To properly store, market and maintain the data and algorithms, decentralized infrastructure needs to be created. These are the organizations currently doing work in this field. 

Not Yet Participating: dClimate 
A transparent, decentralized marketplace that allows participants to buy and share data and contribute to an open ecosystem of data-driven climate resilience applications.

Not Yet Participating: Ocean Protocol 
A data market app to publish, discover, and consume data in a secure, privacy-preserving fashion.

Not Yet Participating: Arweave 
A decentralized data storage system for permanently storing data. Has enabled the backbone for profit sharing when algorithms are used.

Not Yet Participating: IPFS
A decentralized data storage system for permanently storing data. Allowing for upgrading of data without overwriting. 

Domain Experts
For each regenerative action type there are domain specialists. For example an ocean scientist is unlikely to know how to appropriately value tree planting, vice versa. In order to develop analysis algorithms appropriate to each regenerative action type, this specialized knowledge needs to be brought into the dMRV system. 
As these domain experts are the ones likely to start creating tokens from the dMRV system (onboarding non web3 regenerative actions into this space) it is encouraged that a percent of their revenue goes towards supporting the dMRV system and if able provide grants for supporting the initial start of this. These organizations will not have control of the dMRV treasury. 

Endangered Tokens Foundation
Endangered species are especially fragile and need extreme support as quick as possible in order to maintain and increase their population before they go extinct. This organization is reevaluating the biodiversity that these species represent by creating web3 assets (NFTs, tokens). This organization brings specialized knowledge into this area and is working on the ground to ensure that the endangered species are being protected, along with collecting data about the regenerative actions being done around these species.

Kolektivo
Curacao has been benefiting from the efforts of this organization for the last couple of years. From this the organization gained substantial expertise in working with local communities and creating local economic systems. 

Avano
Avano is creating a NFT layer for supporting regenerative actions. Avano has specialized in utilizing the InVEST toolset from the Natural Capital project for analyzing regenerative actions and the monetary value of ecosystem services provided by them.

Not Yet Participating: Moonjelly
A decentralized ocean conservation organization that has world class scientists and data intelligence personnel, specializing in the ocean, throughout the organization. Linwood Pendleton Ph.d. is an example of such a scientist. Has experts in the field of ocean monitoring and verification.

Not Yet Participating: Open Forest Protocol
This organization brings specialized knowledge sets for reforestation and afforestation projects throughout the world.

	tldr: Help fund the publication + distribution of Provable Democracy, a free ebook. We'll also be producing open-source code to make concepts come to life. 
	
	Problem: How can we evolve Democracy through Web3?
	
	Problem Narrative 
	When we think of the algorithms running web3, we think of PoW, PoS, DPoS. These are what keeps us in enough agreement over network state that we place trust in our financial transactions. But are these algorithms applicable to a social perspective? 
	
	I would say no, not really. And they don’t have to be. Producing blocks that secure a state across a network is different than deciding on legal policy that secures the life, liberty and property of a nation. They show the technology is here + accepted, but who will develop the social systems that will affect our grandkids? What groups will implement them? And what is a social system anyway?
	
	The shining social system is Democracy, a concept that has changed with the times from clay pots to representation. We are no longer bound by time in communication, or distance in representation, so it stands to reason that we’re already going through a revolution in democracy, from Gitcoin, to DPoS, to DAOs.
	
	 Democracy is often linked to politics and governance, but today, some of the most impactful decisions are our interactions that drive the algorithms that determine what content is shown to hungry minds scrolling their phones. If only we knew how these algorithms made their decisions. 
	
	Solution: Define key primitives + functions needed for democratic systems to develop in unique ways.
	
	Solution Narrative 
	Now we have the opportunity to explore systems and ways to solve the same problem: Human Collaboration towards Common Desires. We have the time to step back and look at how we are interacting, and where our information comes from. We have the leeway to re-define what is the bare-minimum level of democracy we accept for each type of system (social media, music playlists, running a country).Theses minimums are, in part, the primitives that must be defined and agreed upon for any fair system to develop. 
	
	For just one primitive, personhood, many independent solutions exist, ranging from KYC platforms, to social verification solutions such Proof of Humanity, to biometric options like you use to unlock your phone. But verifying a person is only one aspect of democracy to explore. Supporting this grant means more exploration, and more solutions in-code.
	
	
	How your support drives change. 

I love writing about biomimetic tokenomic systems and structuring data primitives, but if no one reads it, what did I write? And if I am making a public good of my own ideology, who does that really serve? 

My goal with this project isn’t to preach all my great ideas. it’s to first create the common knowledge that new Web3 democracies exist, and show how to integrate them. To accomplish this mission, we need to share the working democratic ideas that reveal the functional inefficiencies in current power structures, including existing DAO structures. 40% of your ETHergy transfer will be used on branding and downloadable media information (PDFs, short video, etc) to educate, and ensure the code hits.


And code is important. The remaining grant will be used to fund writing and curating code. Awesome Repo will swell with DAOs and DHOs and DXOs or whatever is next. The next wave of developers and decision makers on a global scale are granted opportunity to discover and build software that makes society run smoother. (or so we hope)

7069,basket.cash,0,0x0000000000eFFc4317f7aF575fF54cCE3edCd75e,"Basket cash is a way to have DAO governance of tokens backed by baskets of various ERC20 tokens, with the backing ratios able to be rebalanced by vote of basket token holders

Example use case: stablecoin basket, useful for those who don't know which stablecoins are the most secure to have a decentralized consensus to fall back on. If the stablecoin basket was backed by 25% USDC, and the social consensus shifted towards being wary of USDC because of potential blacklisting, informed token holders could vote to rebalance and have the token be backed by only 10%, or 0% USDC. 
Because the voting token is the token backed by the assets, holders are incentivized to vote for the best assets, so they don't lose money, and so this becomes a reasonable measure of social consensus of which stablecoins to trust with your money, for people who are less informed.
This could also be used for social consensus of staked ETH tokens, or a sort of on-chain ""ETF"" of a bunch of different tokens, or anything you can come up with!
It may be possible to have different tokenomics and governance if people really really want it, but this is the basic idea, and this description will likely be improved in the near future. (quadratic voting maybe?)

7072,Hedgefox,0,0x089300e3Cd93dbC23c93cC9B8C237F829CE51b04,"We’re building a cornerstone for decentralized academia by creating a learning app that rewards its participants with tokens and NFT certificates.

TL;DR
What is Hedgefox?
Hedgefox is primarily a web-based, mobile-friendly learning platform and eventual DAO that rewards its learners and teachers for participating in the app through issuing crypto tokens and NFT certificates. We hope to help individuals and institutions rethink what higher education could look like - not as a centralized, expensive, and cumbersome machine, but potentially as an open, interactive, and affordable ecosystem of ideas, communities, and investment.

What’s the value proposition?


What if we could pay students to learn?
Hedgefox started with a very simple question - what if you could pay people to learn? What would that do for the well-being of millions of people across the globe? What if we could provide people with more incentive to better themselves without sacrificing their financial stability? The result would be a positive-sum game wherein students, teachers, employers, institutions, and investors are all able to benefit from a learning ecosystem that is both sustainable and profitable.
Thanks to blockchain technology and cryptocurrencies, we are able to build systems that make this possible. As we have seen in new innovations such as DeFi, gaming, and NFTs, blockchain tech opens up a new paradigm that allows the users to control and benefit from complex systems rather than a select few. In the same way that blockchain has decentralized finance, art, companies, and entertainment, so it can decentralize education without negatively impacting the existing institutions and ecosystem.

Project Goals
The Hedgefox purpose is to build a sustainable and profitable informal social learning platform that results in both a financially positive-sum game for all stakeholders and competent and compassionate problem solvers. While there are a myriad of goals that could be pursued by the Hedgefox project, there are 4 primary problems we’ve framed as goals that we feel are both attainable and within the scope of blockchain technology.
These are:

Reduce student debt across a variety of sectors. This includes higher education, professional education, and social education.

Enact universal, verifiable credentials that are stored on-chain. These take the form of personalized NFTs that can be used for professional or educational purposes.

Reduce knowledge silos. Knowledge is often hidden and contained within select institutions, but open education is helping to change this.

Create a framework for creating high-quality, peer-reviewed content. Starting with informal and social learning, Hedgefox hopes to be a hub for institutions, learners, faculty, employers, and investors to create incredible content through community consensus.

Background
The proliferation of Twitter, TikTok, Reddit, and other short-form content has exacerbated the attention deficit we experience in our lives. As a result, the way we learn as humans is fundamentally changing as well. People find it more difficult to not only find time to learn, but they also demand the flexibility to do it anywhere and at their own pace.
Many people unknowingly have created their own personal learning networks (PLNs) through community tools such as Discord, Telegram, Twitter, Reddit, Quora, and niche email newsletters. These micro-learning environments are difficult to quantify and even more difficult to reproduce effectively in traditional education.

Taking Cues
Hedgefox seeks to take cues from these trends and build a learning platform that hinges on threaded short-form content. Such content should be both easily consumable and incredibly rewarding for the learner. By combining communal, short-form content types, we hope to intentionally create an informal learning platform that is impactful and high-quality - something that is highly elusive within traditional pedagogy.
We believe the best learning occurs when learners are self-directed, in community with others, and have the opportunity to engage with high-quality content tailored to their interests.

Cool, but what does that look like?
If you've ever used Twitter, you know that many people are obsessed with making threads of tweets for people to read. There is even a Twitter thread unroller app that you can use to read threaded tweets more like a book. What we discovered is that there is an immense amount of knowledge buried in short-form content like this on sites like Twitter, Reddit, Quora, and even TikTok. By providing a similar, yet expanded experience to learners, we hope to incentivize learners to create and learn from a community of people while being rewarded to do so.
The platform will utilize a hierarchical system comprised of Creds (as opposed to threads 😆), Pages, and Blocks. Each Cred will be centered around a topic or competency for learners to engage with. Within each Cred are various Pages or sub-topics. Within each Page, is a list of content Blocks such as text, links, videos, audio clips, and questions. By structuring content in this way, learners are able to clearly see what they are learning and how the concepts interplay.
Additionally, each Page will eventually have a discussion area where users can comment and discuss about the content. Providing a space for interaction allows learners to hear different perspectives and perhaps make lasting professional connections with others.

Mobile-First
Creating a platform with priorities on mobile responsiveness and accessibility is paramount for Hedgefox. Focusing on developing a mobile-first platform has several important motivators:

The majority of the world has a cell phone, but far fewer people have access to internet and a desktop or laptop computer. Being mobile-first allows us to reach those who will value access to education the most.
The majority of all social experiences take place on mobile. Hedgefox seeks first to become a social learning platform for adoption purposes so mobile-first makes sense.
Mobile learning is increasingly a more common way to consume content and interact with educational content. Learners demand the flexibility and agency that mobile-first platforms offer.

The HFOX Token
Technicals
The native utility, incentivization, and governance token for Hedgefox is HFOX - an ERC20 token on the Ethereum mainnet. While operating smart-contracts on Ethereum mainnet is not ideal in terms of speed or transaction cost, it does provide our users with the best experience for cashing out their earnings and transferring them among wallets and exchanges. It also ensures future interoperability with other blockchains through Ethereum bridges, oracles, and other blockchain solutions. Should the future DAO vote to create a standalone blockchain network, ERC20 standards make this migration much easier. Additionally, building on Ethereum mainnet also ensures compatibility with a variety of industry standard wallets and dApps. With the introduction of the Ethereum Consensus Layer, adoption of Ethereum is likely to become highly mainstream, ensuring a robust ecosystem for HFOX holders to participate in for years to come.

Burning and Minting
The foundation for Hedgefox's unique tokenomics is a delicate balance of the minting and burning of tokens. This mechanism aims to keep the supply of learners balanced with the token supply, always ensuring the protocol is able to pay its participants without creating rampant inflation or diluting current holders.
By burning and minting tokens based on completion rates, it is possible to create a sustainable payout system that leverages supply/demand and user incentive to maintain a balance between token supply, token price, and user supply. The burn rate and mint rate are levers that the protocol and eventual DAO has at its disposal to maintain stability and sustainability. These rates are based on the total reserve amount left so that theoretically, the Reserves are never depleted.

Initial Burn Rate per block per Start: %0.00001 of Reserves
Initial Reward Rate per block per Completion: **%**0.00001 of Reserves
Initial Mint Rate per block per Completion: %0.000025 of Reserves

The mint rate will always need to be at least double the burn and reward rates in order to replace tokens that are burned/rewarded, but this can also be decided on by the DAO in the future. The protocol only mints tokens when there are more cred completions than cred starts.

User Flow and Process
When a user begins a cred on the platform (either learning, teaching, or peer-reviewing), it is marked in their user record that a certain amount of tokens should be burned from the Hedgefox Reserves - the actual burn takes place later. This decreases the remaining supply and slightly increases the value of the remaining tokens. The more people who begin creds, the more tokens will be burned. As the price per token increases so does the incentive to complete the cred, because...
Once a user completes a cred, it is marked in their user record that tokens should be minted to the Hedgefox Reserves and the majority of those tokens be rewarded to the user - the actual payout and mint takes place later. As more users complete courses, the supply of the token increases which decreases the price of the remaining tokens (inflation). Thus, if cred completion rates remain high for extended periods of time, HFOX token will become inflationary. If completion remains low, the HFOX token becomes deflationary as people start or abandon creds without completing them.

Initial Distribution
The initial and maximum supply of the HFOX token is 1.65 billion. And is distributed as follows:


Non-Fungible Token Certificates

Non-fungible tokens serve as a valuable technology in the Hedgefox ecosystem. When a user completes a credential in any way as a learner, faculty, or peer-reviewer, an NFT is minted on the Hedgefox credential NFT contract and sent to their wallet. The minted NFT contains attributes about the credential, the Hedgefox user who completed it, when it was completed, and other important information. The new NFT serves as an immutable badge that the Hedgefox user can show to potential employers, colleagues, or other learners. Because of blockchain technology, even if the credential NFT is sold, lost, or burned, it will always be able to be verified that the user completed the credential. Moreover, NFTs are easily shareable, easily displayed, and easily verified through platforms such as OpenSea, TofuNFT, Zapper, or other wallets. Users will be able to see and share Hedgefox credentials in the Hedgefox app as well. NFT's also open the door to solving a major issue in academia by providing verifiable, universal credentialing that can be published, transferred, and verified by any institution or organization. This eliminates major complications for several stakeholders:
It becomes easier for learners to transfer credits across institutions.
It becomes easier for employers to verify an applicants transcripts.
It becomes easier for institutions to publish and track learner and faculty achievements.
It allows Hedgefox to formally recognize strategic partners and generous donors through limited edition tokens.",Valid Ethereum Address. 
7073,Good Science Project,0,0xfAbEef09B6a14c380e7798B434A058Dbb1F215b2,"Goal: The goal of the Good Science Project is better science funding in the United States that leads to faster scientific innovation than the status quo.  That is, science funding should: 
Be more streamlined with fewer administrative burdens; 
Have less focus on incremental advances based on preliminary results, and more willingness to consider high-risk projects, open-ended exploration of basic science, etc.; 
Offer more funding for a person/team over longer time frames, rather than narrowly specified projects over short time frames; and, 
Be more open to areas outside of the current status quo. 
These ideas can be reduced to specific policy proposals depending on what is politically feasible. 

Strategy and Activities: Our theory of change is that compelling public communication over the long term can be very influential to steer public discourse and policy conversations. Our communications will take numerous forms – white papers, essays and blog posts, op-eds, social media, and interviews with practicing scientists. As well, we're co-sponsoring a conference this fall with Brookings and the Institute for Progress on a problem that Stuart identified (the NIH hasn't been using an advisory board that Congress mandated as a way to achieve reform). As Jack Clark from Anthropic says, “People wildly underestimate how much influence individuals can have in policy. I've had a decent amount of impact by just turning up and working on the same core issues (measurement and monitoring) for multiple years.”

A secondary work product is interaction with policymakers, whether at agencies, Congress, or the White House. Our key advisers include former White House and NSF personnel, and a number of policymakers (from ARPA-H to congressional staff) have asked us for advice and ideas. 

Personnel: The Good Science Project is led by Stuart Buck. He spent 9 years as the VP of Research at Arnold Ventures, where he led internationally-renowned work on scientific reproducibility, including strategizing the launch of the Center for Open Science, the TOP Guidelines, Vivli, and more. He was an expert adviser to the GAO on its recent report on improving federally-funded research. He has lectured at DARPA and IARPA, and has authored pieces in Science and Nature, on how to improve research.

Eric Gilliam is a Fellow of the Good Science Project, and has done extensive work analyzing science policy. In the near future, we hope to hire a Senior Fellow who can focus on improving how clinical trials are funded and operated. 

In the longer term, we hope to hire:
Two or three people with experience in science policy and communications, and the gravitas to meet with policymakers. 
An administrative person who can do everything from editing articles to planning convenings, and

7074,Dragon Era Online,0,0x19BD5dF2bd715a83661037302426953EDbC11D07,"Dragon Era Online is an MMORPG available for mobile on Google Play - https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=nedi.game.dragononlinemmorpg

It has a small community and is loved by many people. Game is made in Unity making it playable on all platforms but the best experience is on mobile.

The team decided to start using zk-sync technology for remaking it into a futuristic game where people hold the assets, not the game itself and also provide more content in a more modern way, not the regular ways where people just play for a bit and quit the game.

The perfect adaptation into the next generation games lies in the layer 2 technology - fast, no gas and secure. 

What are the next steps for the team -
Port it to a web browser game(mainly the controller and movement)
Integrate web3
Create a free NFT collection on layer 2

The goal for this grant is to bring all the web2 people who loved the game and all the new people that want a free Dragon MMORPG to seamlessly come into web3. This is a passion project developed for many years.

WOO3 is a DAO management platform, and we bring a revolutionary way of working to DAOs, with the power of SBT

	Our vision:
To build infrastructure, enabling DAOs worldwide to achieve better governance by leveraging the power of SBT
Setup an open data network, WOO3 helps DAO members build up their reputations and showcase their contribution.
	
	Our solutions:
		In response to the current problems of DAO, we rely on the non-transferable, verifiable, growable, and revocable characteristics of SBT to propose a series of solutions:

Mission achievement:  Based on SBT, the achievements of community contributors are affirmed and recorded, so that the achievements of contributors can be permanently preserved and have the characteristics of growth and cross-community;
Identity authentication:  Different from the previous verification of holding tokens or nft, SBT will be distributed as a proof of affiliation between the community and members, which cannot be forged, and can carry members’ reputation and contributions
Governance:  Because SBT can carry contributions and identities, the governance rights of DAO can be better realized by relying on SBT, which can return the governance rights to the real contributors of the community, improve the efficiency of decision-making, and can effectively prevent sybil attack, etc.
Incentive system:  Due to the above advantages of SBT, community members can be better motivated and distributed, such as airdrop rewards, income distribution, etc.
Identity across communities:  Based on the characteristics of SBT, we can build an open data network, so that members’ achievements and contributions can be recognized among different DAO, and form a complete personal achievement resume of members.

		Based on the above vision and plan, we will provide a one-stop DAO management platform and tools, including proposal voting, role identity, organizational structure, etc., and SBT will serve as the carrier of DAO’s internal membership and rights, and drive better governance and operation of whole DAO.

		Now we are working hard to achieve all the above. Welcome to join us and witness this revolution about SBT and DAO governance with us.",Valid Ethereum Address.

		Digital service providers (DSPs) often act as curators, who grabbed most of the user's interests through channel advantages. In order for everyone to freely choose their role (creator or curator or delegator or developer) and benefit from it in ownership economy, we introduce TheBards, a fully decentralized NFTs curation economy protocol built with public blockchain infrastructure and other decentralized technologies.

1. Mission

		Promoting the efficient and synchronized circulation of information and value, so as to mint the value of everyone.

2. Motivations
	2.1. We are Creatures of Stories

	Yuval Noah Harari's best-seller book, “Sapiens: A Brief History of Humankind[1],” claims that gossip, based on judgments, began our rule of the planet. Before we began gossiping with other Homo sapiens, we were merely another mammal in the food chain.
	Gossiping empowered us to bond with others socially, create friendships and even hierarchies, allowing us to cooperate while gaining an edge on the animal kingdom. Gossip is one of the unheralded foundations of our species and its survival, Harari concludes.
	“Social cooperation is our key for survival and reproduction,” he writes in the book. “It is not enough for individual men and women to know the whereabouts of lions and bisons. It’s much more important for them to know who in their band hates whom, who is sleeping with whom, who is honest and who is a cheat.”
	He conjectures that the cognitive demands to socialize in groups drove the growth of the human brain, eventually leading to language and other activities that allowed us to organize more effectively for survival. One of these attributes that emerged from greater socialization and larger brains, was storytelling — the ability to construct imagined realities. Storytelling allowed us to develop beliefs, narratives, and other purely intellectual constructs, such as religions, companies, nations, and liberal humanism, which furthered our social and organizational capabilities. Harari uses the example of a limited liability corporation — a completely imaginary entity that nevertheless organizes the work of many people, carrying out a mission across time and space because so many people accept the corporation to be as real as a tree or stone. Other animals do not have LLCs but instead live in the tangible, physical world.
	Throughout history, we listen to stories and create our own stories all the time. We organize things and individuals effectively through stories. We create family stories to build blood ties, company stories to capture value, and religious stories to build beliefs. 
	In general, we are creatures of stories, who reach a consensus through stories, and will continue to tell stories and tell them better.

	2.2. The Power of Stories in Decision Making

	Nassim Taleb suggests the Andrey Nikolayevich Rule[5], which says that in real-world economic life we are faced with a lot of information that is costly to obtain, costly to store, and costly to manipulate and retrieve. As a result, we simplify: we reduce the dimensions of life through the use of stories.
	According to Taleb, stories help us to make the world “less random than it actually is,” and they can fit in with our incessant drive for sense-making.[7] Chater & Loewenstein similarly posit that our hardwiring for stories is based upon our dislike for entropy or disorder.[7] We try to organize our lives into narratives, to force sense into the randomness around us.
	So, there is good reason to believe that we use stories in the way we think, and decision making too[5].
Therefore, the ultimate decision to purchase may not be based merely on the specific features of the goods and services, but rather the imagined sequence of events as a whole. In other words, our choices often rely on narratives.
	This is arguably what GoPro does so well. They don’t sell you the features of their cameras. They sell you the swashbuckling, risk-taking, adventurous lifestyle narrative that accompanies their cameras. 

	2.3. The Curation is Storytelling

	Curation is care over objects or, in Merriam-Webster’s case, care over words traditionally. Jacob Horn, the Founder of Zora provided a new definition: curation is the act of creating context[2]. This definition is a bit complicated and not elegant. Curation is essentially storytelling, by which we deliver value and build consensus, just as we humans do all the time. That is, by organizing things in a certain form, trying to convey a certain information or value, so as to form a consensus among the crowd, which is no different from organizing words to tell a story.
	Amazon curates thousands of products and tells a story about e-commerce; Facebook curates our social relationships and tells the story of social networks; Google curates information and tells the story of search engines. Here are a few examples of big Internet companies. In fact, all companies in the world are trying to tell their stories by curating their products and services. Once our minds accept their stories, we enter into their stories, just like an ignorant moth falling into a spider's web, which cannot be easily eliminated. This may be the deep-seated reason for monopoly.
	We don't want to fall into the stories weaved by the big internet companies and be sold to ad agencies for profit, they are actually taking advantage of us and yet we get very little or nothing.
In web3, data is publicly accessible, decentralized curation is still needed and becomes more important and valuable. We may tell our own stories by curating who we are, what we have, and what we do.

3. Problems

	We see a lot of special challenges that creators and curators are facing today.
	
	● Digital service providers (DSPs) often act as curators, they decide what users will see, thus selling our attention as a product to advertisers.
	● Incomplete rights ownership data often prevents content creators and curators from getting paid; instead, earnings accumulate in digital service providers and rights societies.
	● There are layers of middlemen and significant time delay involved in payments to creators and curators.
	● Publishing rights are complicated and opaque, with no incentives for the industry to make rights data public and accurate.
	● Licensing issues prevent DSPs and content from being accessible worldwide.

4. Solution

	We believe that curation is trying to tell a story about someone's work, life, entertainment, skills, etc. TheBards is a Creator + Curation + NFT economy system. For simplicity, hereafter collectively referred to as the curation economy. Smart contracts specify the interaction between the four roles (like creator, curator, delegator, developer) and the fair distribution of profits in the system. 
	It is worth noting that we regard user profiles, feeds and Dapps as curations, so delegator can also stake TBT to the above objects at the same time.

	4.1. Curations

	Curations will be minted into NFTs, which can be collected and pledged by anyone to share benefits. There are the following curatorial types:

	● Self curation: Presented as a CV or profile NFT that explains who we are, what we have and what we do.
	● Single curation: Expressed as basic posts, such as microblogs, articles, audio, video, etc., used to show the creator's gigs, ideas, work, life, knowledge, tastes, etc., which will be minted as NFTs by default, so they can be collected by fans and used as creator's soulband items.
	● Combined curation: Various organic combinations of content are also a way of curation, just like the mutual achievement of video and music in tiktok, which will produce a magical chemical reaction.
	● Protfolio curation: Equally and purposefully combine content into a list, such as a jazz playlist.
	● Feed curation: Featured or specific types of information streams, such as news, funny videos, audio novels, etc.

	4.2. Stakeholders

	In our curation economy system, including the following stakeholders, our protocols will define the interaction between them and the distribution of benefits.

	● Creator: Creators publish microblogs, articles, pictures, audios, videos, Q&A, etc. as NFTs.
	● Curator: Curators are also creators. However, They try to combine different elements to tell a story. Like a literati combining words into prose, like a musician combining notes into a symphony. It is worth noting that the main curation method of this article is combined curation, protfdio curation, and feed curation, excludes the other two special curation types. The TheBards rewards Curators that tell a unique and valuable story earn a share of sale fees of NFTs and rewards.
	● Delegator: Delegator are critical to the decentralized curation economy. They use their knowledge or intuition to assess and signal on the curations. Delegator are economically incentivized to siganl early. By signalling on a curation, you will earn a share of all the curation share revenue that this curation generates. x% of all curation share revenue goes to the delegators pro-rata to their delegation shares. 
	● Developer: Create a feed curation or use existing data or feeds in a dapp.
We are familiar with creator and developer. Next, we will focus on delegator and curator.
	
	4.3. Delegator

	Each curation has a bonding curve[3] on which delegation shares are minted when a user delegate (i.e., ""stake"") TBT to the curve. Each curation’s bonding curve is unique. The bonding curves are architected so that the price to mint a delegation share on a curation increases linearly, over the number of shares minted.
In general, a bonding curve is a mathematical curve that defines the relationship between token supply and asset price. In the specific case of content curation, the price of each curation share increases with each token invested and the price of each share decreases with each token sold.
	Delegator make the curation economy system efficient and end users know that a curation is good to focus on, where TBT is added to a bonding curve for a curation. End users can inherently trust the signal from a delegator because upon signaling, delegators mint a delegation share for the curation, entitling them to a portion of future curation fees that the curation drives. Delegator signal is represented as ERC20 tokens called Curation Delegator Shares (CDS). Delegators that want to earn more delegation fees should signal their TBT to curations that they predict will generate a strong flow of fees to the network. Delegators cannot be slashed for bad behavior, but there is a deposit tax on delegators to disincentivize poor decision-making that could harm the integrity of the network. Delegators also earn fewer delegation fees if they choose to delegate on a low-quality curation since there will be poor content quality, inconsistent content with curated theme, deeply nested curation, etc.

	4.4. Curator

	For curators, we think of shops, galleries, museums, etc., which are paid for providing a channels to display and sell merchandise, paintings, artworks, etc. Curators in our economic system likewise profit by creating meaningful context for commodities (NFTs) to induce purchasing decisions.
NFTs issued through our protocol will be customizable with sales splits, ie., curation fee cut, which is the portion of the rewards that the NFT owner will keep for themselves. That means if it is set to 100%, as a curator you will get 0 curation rewards. If you see 80% in the UI, that means as a curator, you will receive 20%.

	4.5. A User Case

	Chloe is a travel blogger living in the UK. She usually travels all over the world, writing, taking pictures, and living the free life that people yearn for. 
	She regularly uploads her travel articles, videos and photos to StoryLine, a hypothetical social networking application based on the TheBards Protocol. The app will mint her content into NFTs. Her fans collect her content NFTs through purchases. A travel genre curator or feed service provider will organize her content into a collection or index it in a database. 
	She can skillfully refer to travel-related NFTs in her content with links. She can also get a certain share of the purchases fees triggered by her content, and the corresponding curators who curate her content will also have a corresponding share, all of which are stipulated in the smart contract. Delegators in the tourism field will stake their TBT to the corresponding curations, hoping to have curatorial revenue sharing in the future.

	4.6. Static and Dynamic Distribution

	As shown in the figure below, the system includes two value distribution modes: static and dynamic distribution. Static distribution occurs on a single curation entity, whose distribution is fixed. Whereas dynamic distribution is related to the context of each transaction, i.e. curation. When the curation is different, the benefit distribution will be different. For example, 2-level nested curation and 3-level nested curation allocation scheme will be different.

	● Static Distribution: or down distribution[4], stakeholders are fixed, and the distribution ratio is also fixed.
	● Dynamic Distribution: or up distribution, stakeholders and allocation ratios depend on the context in which each transaction occurs, i.e. we have to dynamically determine which curators are there and how the value is distributed.

5. Tokenomics

	The purpose of the TheBards token (TBT) is to coordinate, bootstrap, and incentivize participants to make sure the curation economy is as effective, secure, reliable and useful as possible. In the TheBards protocol, TBT is used to buy NFTs and stake the token to mint the delegation share, the more TBT you stake, the more shares you will get for exchanging income. 
	When a user purchases NFTs in the context of content or curation, both creator and curator earn a partion of those curation share fees as a reward for contexts created for triggering purchase decisions.

	5.1. Rewarding Stakeholders

	In addition to earning curation share fees, TheBards mints new token over time, much like Bitcoin and Ethereum block rewards, which are split amongst curations in proportion to their total stake relative to others in the system.
	This has the effect of growing system ownership amongst those who participate and shrinking it amongst those who do not.

	5.2. Rounds & Inflation

	In TheBards, new tokens are minted every so-called round. Rounds are measured in Ethereum blocks, where one round is equal to 5760 Ethereum blocks. In Ethereum, one block is mined on average every 14.89 seconds, which means one TheBards round lasts roughly 23.82 hours. Assuming the curations you're staked to is doing its job, this is how often you can expect to receive reward tokens.
	The cool thing about TheBards is the inflation rate adjusts automatically depending on how many tokens are staked out of the total circulating supply. TheBards presupposes that a target rate of T% is a healthy trade-off between network security and token liquidity, so in order to hit this target, the protocol incentivizes stakeholders by increasing the inflation rate by a% for every round the participation rate is below T% and decreasing it a% for every round the participation rate is above T%.

DeFi’s Everyday User Experience Is About To Become 10x times Better

DeFi has a modest $100,000,000,000 worth of value locked into it.
Nonetheless, relative to its objectives and core functionalities — it is a pain in the a*s to use. 
In its attempt to be an easily-accessible alternative to traditional finance, DeFi has created its own bubble of poor, manual & highly fragmented user experience, with a high entry barrier that requires vast time and often specific industry/technical knowledge. DeFi users are left confused, allowing their yields to crumble, and their assets' risks to thrive — but it doesn't have to be that way.

Introducing Yieldchain — DeFi’s 0-code Yield Composability Layer
Yieldchain is solving DeFi’s impractical & fragmented user experience by allowing everyday, non-technical users to assemble their own, fully customizable 0-code yield strategies, on top of absolutely any protocol, pool, or asset — and deploy it as a fully functional & automatic vault with the click of a button.
Yield Strategies — WTF are they?

Yield strategies are, simply put, the act of utilizing your yields in a certain way, or order, with the intention of maximizing them, to adjust your risk level.
The most simple example of a yield strategy would be yield compounding, the strategy goes as follows:
Deposit tokens > Claim Rewards > Deposit Tokens (rewards)
By utilizing a yield strategy, you are benefiting from compound interest, which results in increased yields over a period of time.

Yield strategies can be as simple or as complex as you'd like - they are catered to your own specific needs, assets/platforms preferences, and risk tolerance.

                        

Presently, to benefit from yield strategies (AKA increased yields & mitigated risk), users need to manually execute them - Which means: Going on multiple dApps, signing multiple transactions, moving funds around, etc.
With Yieldchain, though, users can effortlessly assemble their strategy's steps ONCE -  and with the click of a button, deploy it as an automatic, fully functional vault - on a no-code interface that requires no technical knowledge at all, built with YOUR - The everyday user's needs, in mind.

Full composability - Build on top of any pool/protocol. Seriously.
Is the protocol/pool you want to utilize within your strategy not yet integrated into Yieldchain? Yieldchain not only enables users to assemble their own no-code yield strategies - it allows them to do so on top of any protocol/pool that exists in DeFi. Instantaneously & seamlessly plug in pools & protocols with the click of a button - Using its website link (URL), within 30 seconds - and immediately assemble your strategy on top of it.
                                    

   

Social Finance (SocialFi) - Vaults are public, permissionless - Share strategies with others!
Any vault deployed on Yieldchain is immediately accessible for anyone to deposit into. Users can see the vault's details, its strategy, etc - and with the click of a button, deposit their funds into it, beginning to automatically utilize it.
Don't want to assemble your own strategy? Simply search for an asset, and deposit into one of the available vaults - You are just one click away from earning maximal yields!

7036,Neutral Protocol - On-chain carbon derivatives,0,0x4B52A1feB5eF62D61cEa2834f0E98A03bB5d7656,"""👋 Introduction to Neutral

We’re building the derivatives hub for the ReFi ecosystem, allowing users to trade carbon futures and options on Neutral's platform. Our core offerings will be perpetual futures and European carbon options with elective physical settlement.

Neutral's platform will allow carbon holders, brokers, and liquidity providers to hedge their holdings; offsetting entities to secure the cost of their sustainability goals / offsetting schedule; and carbon originators to conduct better investment analysis.

Providing a derivatives platform for carbon will allow for yield and net-neutral strategies to be built on top, allowing carbon holders to earn passive yield on their holdings and offsetting users to optimize and automate their offsetting goals. Neutral will develop net-neutral strategies and support the development of yield strategies on top of our platform after successful delivery of the base derivative products.

🌲 Why carbon derivatives?

Looking at off-chain activity, organizations that have to follow carbon compliance schema use carbon derivatives to manage their costs and hedge their carbon positions. Organizations engaging in voluntary offsetting or have business models / positions with indirect exposure to carbon prices can also use derivatives to mitigate their risks. Off-chain derivatives also provide signals on future carbon prices, allowing carbon originators to conduct better investment analysis, informs organizations on the costs of their sustainability objectives, and provides policy makers with additional information to increase policy effectiveness.

As the carbon market moves on-chain, similar on-chain utility needs to be developed. At Neutral we have been working hard to develop on-chain carbon derivatives, another key piece in the ReFi ecosystem, to move us closer towards a mature, thriving on-chain carbon market.

⚙️ Product description



Users will be able to trade perpetual futures (perps) and European carbon options with optional physical delivery. We'll first introduce perps as they’re a well-known, easy-to-use, hedging mechanism that doesn’t fragment liquidity. Perp traders will be able to use carbon as collateral, increasing on-chain utility and allowing users to execute a long-short position in a single transaction.

As the ecosystem matures and liquidity increases, we'll start delivering more sophisticated derivative products. European carbon options will enable carbon yield vaults and improved net-neutral execution, providing offsetters with price stability and carbon holders with yield opportunities. Providing the core suite of derivative products will allow for composability and construction of complex positions with easy execution, management, and cross-margining.",Valid Ethereum Address.

Useful Recommendations.Facing hard tasks again? Is it the infamous case study this time? As a matter of fact, there is a way to deal with it in practically no time. Let’s see what questions you might have.
Case Study Research Definition: Nailing the Concept Essence Down
What is a case study? According to the scientists from the site paper helper, case study is a method of research that allows to conduct the analysis of the factors which have a certain impact on the object of the research.You might also wonder: what are correct case study research design and methods. Don’t let the whole thing confuse you – a case study already is a method of research and its specific design.

Case study involves data gathering (67% of the staff participated in the meeting);   
Case study requires designing research tools (Fill in the given questionnaire…);   
Case study involves offering specific solutions (In the given case, it is reasonable to schedule the work…

If you want to see a case study live, here’s a perfect opportunity for you. Take a glance at a case study researching the way people cope with the stress of losing their jobs – that’s a hot topic in the light of the recent crisis.
The case in point

Evaluating the potential and professionalism of each employee;
Creating feasible strategies for each of the people involved.
The measures   
Designing specific questionnaires;
Obtaining the information on the employees from the human resources department;
Conducting tests to assess the features of each employee’s temper.
The results

Marking the ways in which the latter managed to succeed;
Offering conclusions and comments on the case.

Case Study Research Writing: Warning! Avoiding Misleading Ideas
Whenever you deal with a case study, remember that there are a number of pitfalls to avoid! Beware of the following mistakes:
Excessive use of fairly restrictive phrases (even though it is a study of a real case, it should sound formal);
Lack of statistical data   (give all important data, both in percentages and in numbers);
Details abuse   (state only the most significant facts);
Inconsistency of methods used (in a case study, theory plays a relatively small part. Develop a specific case study research methodology);
Trivial research means   (create as much as you can on your own, from questionnaires to tables. Design your own case study research method!).Now you are ready to start your own research on a case study. Congratulations!
Nursing Scholarship Essays: What to Focus on
Even if you are good at writing essays, it does not mean you will create the same perfect nursing scholarship essay. However, some skills of yours will definitely play an important role.For instance, your dedication to learning and ability to focus on the most significant things to be included into an essay is one of the keys to writing a strong nursing scholarship essay. To help you narrow down the focus, we have listed things that students are supposed to tell about if they want to get a scholarship:
1.     Past experiences;
2.     Accomplishments;
3.     Future plans and career goals;
4.     Reasons why you deserve this scholarship.
This is what makes nursing scholarship essays strong. Besides, you should focus on these particular areas.Keep in mind that a mere retelling of the major events from your life is not a good way to make an impressive nursing scholarship essay. Here are several hints on how to make your essay stand out.
Tell about your greatest accomplishments
A story about your major achievements is what can make the reader of your nursing scholarship essay think “Wow, this student really deserves this scholarship!” Mind that not all your achievements may seem the same great to the reader. Probably, a story about 100 pancakes that you managed to bake in 2 hours will not fit.
Tell about obstacles on your way
Your ability to manage problems is another way to impress the reader. Yet, do not create some sort of a sad story for your nursing scholarship essay. Do not just tell how difficult a problem was, but how you overcame it.

Management Essays: How to Manage Your Paper
We know why you feel a bit confused at the moment. If a teacher just asked you to write papers in Management, it means you should choose from hundreds of topics. Sure, it is not easy to concentrate on something specific.Anyway, we will help you write your Management essay and get a good grade on it.
Writing papers on Management: where to start
Needless to say, your work on the Management essay should start with narrowing down the focus. At least, you need to decide on a specific branch of Management that you are interested in. So, which branch do you want to investigate while working on your Management paper: risk management, human resource management, or project management?
Writing papers on Management: theory and practice
No matter what branch you choose to investigate in your Management essay, the paper editing should be started with studying theory. All management-related processes and phenomena that you can observe in real life are based on a certain theoretical concept.Therefore, a part of your Management essay will definitely be devoted to theory, which should be further illustrated by practical examples.
Writing papers on Management: where to find good examples
Usually, case studies serve as perfect examples to be included into Management essays. However, if you cannot find a relevant case study, do not worry. A lot of ordinary, everyday situations can be good illustrations to theoretical issues you discuss.Say, you are talking about one of the four functions of management – planning, controlling, organizing, or leading. Why not provide real-life examples of how you plan your studies? How do you control your pocket money? How do you organize your working day?

Energy & Node is seeking a grant to fund our development of an open-source application for demand-side management, as well as the purchase of mining nodes to support energy and power-focused blockchains. 

Demand-side management, or demand-side response, is the modification of consumer demand for energy through various methods such as financial innovation incentives and behavioral change through education. Energy & Node will be influencing both. Our application, named Aware, will allow consumers and utility providers to share data in real-time. Allowing utility providers to make better predictions on the demand and supply of energy to the grid, and allow consumers to support the stability of the grid, while sharing and accessing that data with their neighbors. Users will get a simple mobile application, that encrypts their identity and data through decentralized IDs, and provides a modern and easy-to-navigate interface to receive notifications and submit data. 

You can watch the demo of our app from EthDenver here: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0jDaBwo8b-Q&t=2s&ab_channel=DoraHacks 

Additionally, Energy & Node will run mining nodes to support these blockchains as we seek to integrate as both a dApp and a partner in collaboration towards blockchain to support renewable energy:
Energy Web Chain
Powerledger Chain
Celo Chain
Chia Chain
Topl Chain
Watr Chain
Cosmos Chain
Algorand Chain
GreenTrust Chain

We are seeking funding for equipment purchase of machine hardware.  Miners will initially be set up at a home office, and as equipment is added, we will migrate to a weather-proof, outdoor center fully powered by renewable energy in the mountains of Colorado.

Finally, but not in the scope of this grant, Energy & Node will provide free resources about blockchain in the energy and power environment. We believe every individual (consumers and professionals alike) needs to be powered with the awareness and knowledge of this transformational technology as we move to a net-zero world.",Valid Ethereum Address. https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0jDaBwo8b-Q&t=2s&ab_channel=DoraHacks connection successful.

Zero-Knowledge Machine Learning (zkML) will be the bridge between the Web2 (AI/ML) and the Web3 worlds. With existing projects like Circom and Zk Block, and existing programs like 0xPARC and ZK HACK, the space needs an actual usable dApp to tie these all together. zkMachineLearning is the project that will attract experienced developers in Web2 to join Web3. Traditionally, machine learning bounty platforms, such as Kaggle, require developers to submit their full model to the host for performance verification. The evaluation process is often black-box and rankings cannot be verified. With zkML, we can verify private data with public models, or verify private models with public data (https://gitcoin.co/grants/4847/zkml). That means we can now host bounties that developers do not need to fully disclose their model, and model architecture and weights are only disclosed when the bounty is paid. The application I am building aims to be an all-in-one end-to-end platform that ML developer can quickly convert their models trained in say Tensorflow or PyTorch into a zk-compatible one. The platform will include a library (circomlib-ml, already published and constantly updated) of Circom circuits that compute common layers in Tensorflow/PyTorch, a Python-Circom translator (in development) that will transcribe ML models in Python into a Circom circuit, and a dApp that will host, verify, payout bounties.",Valid Ethereum Address. https://github.com/socathie/circomlib-ml connection successful. https://github.com/socathie/zkML connection successful. https://gitcoin.co/grants/4847/zkml). connection successful.

6851,Magpie Protocol,0,0x9FD49dAf92e29dF8B5132c9a026b99b4281D4f7C,"

What is Magpie?

Magpie Protocol is a cross-chain liquidity aggregator that enables seamless cross-chain swaps with near-instant finality and cost efficiency on many of the top blockchains, all without the need to bridge any assets, making for an extremely fast, secure, easy, and gas-efficient solution. 

Magpie Protocol incorporates a unique technical implementation that allows the execution of cross-chain swaps without the need for the user to bridge assets from any of the top bridges. This saves time and cost by reducing the complexity and security risks involved in using any of the bridging solutions to move assets across chains. 

Compared to other options in DeFi, when a user swaps using Magpie Protocol, they don’t need to go to the corresponding bridge, learn how to use it, spend a bunch of gas on transfers and time waiting, only to then have to go back to the DEX to make a swap. 

While in some ways similar to 0x, Paraswap, and 1inch, the advantage of Magpie Protocol comes in its user experience, security, ease-of-use, and speed, all while providing users with the best prices on tokens both within-chain and cross-chain.


Our Vision: 
We’re shaping the future of how people interact with financial systems built on decentralized, fair, and universally accessible technology. 

Our Mission:
To empower users of all levels by building a cross-chain infrastructure service that offers a simple, efficient, and secure way to trade, invest, and transact within DeFi.

Our Values:
Simplicity, Efficiency and Integrity.

Firstly, the absolute banking rate of our population is around 20%, while the relative rate, which include the mobile money sector is around 40%. 
For those who are fortunate enough to be able to save money in a bank, they won’t get more than 3% in annual return, on average. 
And if they dare to borrow money, they would pay a minimum of 5% of interest rates. When the credit is given by a microfinance structure or through a nanocredit company, the borrower would pay more than 10% of interest. 
Our local merchants and businesses struggle to pay their suppliers due to the weakness of our currency, and to the high fees requested by local banks for international transfers. The migrants also pay really high fees to remittance companies.

Our pilot has the goal to make possible the following : 
- A local exchange would allow the population to easily possess Bitcoin and be their own bank. They would buy and sell Bitcoin with local payment methods. 
 - Merchants and businesses can use Bitcoin bought on Banxaas to send securely to their suppliers, with fees near zero. 
- Migrants can send funds to their family via Bitcoin, which they can sell it on Banxaas to receive fiat currency. Fees are also near zero. 

To achieve this, Banxaas will be a native website, connected to several Bitcoin nodes. The addresses will be generated by some multisig wallets and the accounts will be secured by the state of the art of security and cryptography.

6899,NFT price oracle----Bid to Earn,0,0xFd996230B79bf834a040443315a689EAE880DB12,"Nawarat is an efficient and accurate NFT price oracle that allows anyone to participate and matches the true valuation of the market. It will provide accurate real-time valuation of NFT to address the liquidity problem as well as empower the NFT ecosystem.

Nawarat makes references to the market valuations as the valuation range for forming the implicit Schelling point, then the NFT valuation is further corrected through pricing quotations via group game, normal distribution will be then used to verify the validity of the valuation, making the NFT valuation more precise. On-chain quotation will also make the NFT valuation more reliable. 
 
 
 
Nawarat will introduce a list of reference valuations, incorporating more AI models or other valuation references to construct a real-time dynamic valuation range. In the reference valuation, strangers will have a tacit understanding of the model knowledge and historical performance of the valuation model, forming an implicit Schelling point, which is actually also an implicit valuation range. In other words, it is the same as constructing a real-time dynamic evaluation range for each NFT, and users can generate the final effective price through group bidding, forming a highly accurate NFT valuation.


Nawarat will give different reference valuations to meet the reference needs of different users, and display them on the valuation decision page in the form of a series of reference prices in the end. The list of reference prices will help us establish a range to find the Schelling point. The reference price deviation curve will help users to formulate a more accurate pricing range and thereby, finding the Schelling point from within. The final valuation of each round is then confirmed through group game based on the more precise pricing range of different users. 

Tacit understanding between strangers. Referring to the historical“ performance curve, there may be an implicit Schelling Point, supposed 69.49ETH, which is a rough appraisal generated by models. Taking the implicit Schelling point as the reference valuation, a tacit bidding interval [63.20, 72.22] is naturally established, and ultimately the user will generate a more accurate valuation within this interval through group game. 

As shown in the demonstration below: Each line with different colors（△P1，△P2……△P8）, represent the difference in reference price and each round’s final price under different models, the lines forming the reference price deviation curve, the closer the line is to x-axis then the smaller the gap is between reference price and final price, the closer it is to the final price. For instance, when a user bids on the next round of NFT valuation, △P8,69.49ETH can be confirmed to be the next implicit Schelling point having referenced the below reference price deviation curve, the tacit bidding interval between users is [63.20, 72.22]. The reference price deviation curve can greatly benefit users in finding the Schelling point, and can immensely improve the efficiency and the accuracy of valuation.
 
  

The theoretical basis of Schelling point defines the valuation range, and the normal distribution will find the precise valuation amidst the range, confirming the most accurate NFT valuation.

 In the valuation of NFT, we can delineate the valuation and reference range of NFT through the theoretical basis of the Schelling point. When a group bids on a NFT with a reference valuation range, and if the resulting valuation data present to be a normal distribution spread, then Nawarat believes that this outcome is an effective valuation with a precise valuation result screened by normal distribution.
 

 
Currently, there are various AI valuation models widespread in the market, they are mostly NFT valuations based on various historical prices, which is very general and vague, involving no subjective judgment of NFT users, making the resulting valuation meaningless. Nawarat respects all of the factors, ranging from historical prices to group consensus, finding the ultimate precise valuation through the three-layer screening of AI model, implicit Schelling point and normal distribution. 

By introducing a list of reference prices, Nawarat establishes a range for finding Schelling points, helping users to find Schelling points with the help of the constructed valuation deviation curve, which formulates a more precise valuation range for users. The final and precise valuation of each round will be then confirmed through group game, further verified through normal distribution. Meanwhile, decentralization makes the valuation more reliable, resolving the trust issue associated with the AI pricing black box.

Furthermore we use the framework of the challenge to collect and share data for the ecosystem & reward supreme network performance with a NFT, hand crafted according to different local artist's interpretation of what the word ""BLOCKCHAIN"" inspires in them. Nobody draws twice! 

				🏆 COMPETITION PAGE 🏆

For the challenge we developed a simple Discord bot for the validator key registration to the competition as well as a challenge leaderboard chart to compare your own performances with your peers in an anonymous fashion. 


 
THE IDEA
 
What got the idea behind the Update & Upkeep Challenge going was to design & develop different gamified, non consequential formats to keep the stakers more directly involved in their responsibility & ensure long term engagement of non institution backed individuals. After all, there is no other requirement than to burden the responsibility of running a staking setup to join the challenge.
 
The NFTs Prices awarded so far can be found here:

			🥇 NFT PRICE COLLECTION 🥇
 
To create the prices we commission young artists to create something inspired by the space & are happy to introduce the concepts of NFTs to people in a traditional art environment. We also featured physical prices based on the NFTs, which we hope to bring back soon!
 


FUNDING
 
The past iterations of the challenge came already with extremely positive user feedback. We heard some great tales of node breakdowns and mishaps from the users while distributing the badges and engaging with the community. With the funding we want to address further security concerns, harden cheating prevention, hire more artists and generally level up what one can do with the NFTs!

Decentralized Volunteering (DeVo) Protocol DAO is a goodwill DAO that will redefine volunteerism and philanthropy by introducing: significant rewards for volunteers & users, unprecedented transparency so people can see where their donations are being spent, and trustless & seamless interactions between all stakeholders. We utilize technologies including a DAO, DeFi mechanisms such as rebasing, DIDs, DApp, and NFTs.
We have been working on this project for over a year and a half. We have a world-class team, ranging from Adam Manka who ran ZAP and the Blockchain Center, to Jason Peters who is a Prominent Blockchain Philanthropist, founding and facilitating cutting-edge initiatives that satisfy UN SDG and tackling ESG challenges.
We are searching for funding in order to both effectively continue DApp development and carry out our pilot program.
We are currently in the process of building the first version of our DApp in preparation for our pilot program. 80% of our DApp has been coded. 19,000 volunteers have signed up for DeVo in the span of a week and we have successfully partnered with prominent volunteer organizations such as REFORM Alliance & the Nordic Blockchain Association, in addition to blockchain such as Ethica Exchange & Detrash

6931,ETH-XMR Atomic Swap continued development,0,0xbB7F32d8785A3F3e81c09EcbcE1Ad455A6e8eCa8,"Atomic swaps are a method for trustlessly exchanging funds across blockchains. An ETH-XMR atomic swap will allow for users to, in a trustless and completely decentralized manner, exchange Ether for Monero. This connects the leading smart contract blockchain (and the home of defi) with the leading privacy-preserving blockchain. Along with the BTC-XMR atomic swaps, this will allow for completely decentralized cross-chain exchanges to be built that allow for XMR swaps.

The project currently has a functional prototype that has been deployed onto testnets. This grant is for continued development work, including usability and privacy enhancements.

Previous work

Previously, I completed an MVP implemenetation of the ETH-XMR atomic swap, deployed it to stagenet on 9 different servers, and extensively tested it. There is now an alpha release of ETH-XMR atomic swaps with the following functionality:
- `swapd` program which executes atomic swaps; includes:
   - network layer which allows for peers to make offers and discover and take offers
   - RPC server which allows users to interact with the daemon (eg. make/take offers, get current swaps, cancel swaps)
   - protocol implementation of the atomic swap including all refund paths
- `swapcli` program which implements a CLI for users to interact with the daemon and easily make/take offers
- `swaprecover` program which allows for funds to be recovered in case of a crash
- `ui`: a self-hosted UI for the swap that displays current offers on the network and allows users to take offers using their MetaMask wallet.

Proposed work

I would like to continue work on the ETH-XMR atomic swap implementation by adding improvements for usability and privacy, as well as general codebase maintainence. 

This proposal includes the following development work:

1. Relayer support

The current implementation of the protocol requires the ETH-recipient to have some ETH in their claiming account to pay for the transaction fees to claim the swap ETH. However, this is bad for UX and privacy, as users cannot withdraw to fresh ETH accounts. 

To allow for users to claim ETH into a fresh account, integration with a relayer service can be implemented. This will allow users to withdraw to a fresh account by paying a small fee to a relayer to submit the transaction on their behalf.

2. ERC20 support

To support swaps for ERC20s without hurting liquidity, the swap contract can be integrated with a DEX such as Uniswap to automatically swap received ETH for the desired ERC20 token.

3. Disk permanence

The current implementation of the swap does not store anything to disk apart from information needed for recovery of swap funds in case of failure. However, there are other components that should be stored to disk and restored upon reload, such as current swap offers made, historic swap information, and peer information. This will require a simple key-value database implementation.

4. General maintainence and bugfixes

See https://github.com/AthanorLabs/atomic-swap/issues for open issues on the repo. Issues not covered by the above work are part of this section. This includes RPC calls and documentation, codebase maintainence, testing, and fixes of any bugs found during testing.",Valid Ethereum Address. https://github.com/AthanorLabs/atomic-swap/issues connection successful.

We’re building a platform where you can donate to any cause you
care about with FIAT or Crypto and in return receive a unique 3D
NFT that represents and visualises the real world impact of your
donation.

Through our “play-to-give” metaverse, we’re gamifying the act of
donating to charity and therefore incentivising higher donations
and allowing charities/ NGOs to tap into new demographics.

The Problem
In a digital-led world where Gen Z and Millennials expect highly
engaging, intuitive and easily digestible experiences, the act of
donating to charity has stagnated and tree planting certificates
aren’t doing it for users anymore.

Our Solution
A platform and 3D metaverse that holds the hands of charities into
the often overwhelming world of Web 3/ Blockchain, providing a
highly engaging experience that tells the story of each users’
donation and provides a way of visualising/ sharing the good
people are doing for the planet, its animals and people.

Trees are just the beginning
We’re starting with trees, but eventually you’ll be able to donate to
any cause you care about – whether a long-term charity initiative or
rapid disaster relief.

By early 2023 you’ll be able to explore a fully immersive and
interactive metaverse, full of the good things people are up to.

6910,Iris: Decentralized Terrestrial Satellite Oracle Network,0,0x918d0D7219eDcCF0fb57dddEeA84b9e0E4429733,"Iris was conceived as an effort to produce a technological solution at the intersection of blockchain and space technologies. Iris is a Decentralized Terrestrial Satellite Oracle Network (DtsON) - the first of its kind.

An oracle network’s function is to guarantee the delivery of honest and up-to-date real-world data from a pool of participating data reporters or nodes. Each node submits what it attests is their honest observation of the data point or state the network is trying to provide. Only through the consensus mechanism and committee mechanics of oracle networks are we able to find accurate values for the prices of cryptocurrencies on decentralized exchanges for example. For Iris however, instead of comparing single valued numerical data, Iris’ nodes will compare satellite imagery and determine the image closest in similarity to the super majority (or 66%) of all the other images. We refer to the image chosen by the committee as the Average Scenario. The Average Scenario represents the most likely state one would find the AoI around the time requested.

With this system in place, dApp developers can for the first time trust that the information they eventually find in the image is representative of reality. extract data from the satellite imagery and Once dApp developers understand they can use Iris to extract information, they will have to create their own DONs to extract and verify the information. Doing so would allow dApps to perform permissionless computations that run only upon the behest of the user. 

The idea of chaining a base DON with a Data Distilling DON or ddDON and then connecting the ddDON to a dApp executed on an EVM-like chain will allow users and dApp developers to trust the honest and faithful execution of each step in the product stack. The guarantee of honest fulfillment of financial contracts between people has never been greater than with blockchain technology and bringing oracle technology to geospatial data will extend this to new dApps.

Aside from reinventing the carbon credit/asset market, Iris can be used to extract information for other kinds of dApps. For example, one could build a natural disaster insurance and/or crop insurance application on top of Iris by extracting information that would change the state of the dApps smart contracts and trigger a pay out. Another way to use satellite imagery is to attach imagery of homes and property to on-chain property claims.

6911,Bech: Platform for startups and investors in developing countries,0,0x14DE893ACeA7e8929EbfB0Ea55865DEc826903FC,"The Bech Blockchain achieved a throughput of 296k tps during testing. Ongoing optimizations will likely push it towards a minimum of 400k - 500k tps with 650k tps being the current target for this testing phase.

The platform comes with an inbuilt stock/asset exchange that processes stock trades at a lightening speed and at the same time provides maximum security with its full proof consensus mechanism. 

This on-chain exchange cuts out market makers who mostly act as middlemen on many CEXs and DEXs. Cutting out the middlemen gives the platform the ability to process trades with absolutely zero transaction fees.

 Cryptocurrency blockchains have been widely adopted and accepted by a huge number of retail investors and some institutional investors and as a result have seen a surge in its usage and value over the past few years. 

Meanwhile, there is a large portion of influential institutional investors who still remain skeptic of the value, use and importance of cryptocurrencies to the finance industry and economies as a whole. Despite their popularity, cryptocurrencies and blockchains have failed to fully permeate the finance sector due to a lack of trust in these new technologies. Institutional investors like Warren Buffet and Charlie Munger are the biggest skeptics of cryptocurrencies. They cite the lack of real world value backing of cryptos as their biggest reason for staying away from big cryptocurrencies like Bitcoin, Ethereum, Solana etc. These investors are used to investing in assets that have real world backing like stocks, as these are valued by the company’s efficiency in providing their services and many other factors. Meanwhile, the value of cryptocurrencies is simply based on supply and demand which makes it purely speculative and unpredictable. This tends to keep many influential investors and some retail investors away from potentially investing in the cryptocurrency market. 

Startups and small companies in developing countries and in some cases developed countries in most instances find it difficult to raise funds. A very high percentage of startup funding is totally concentrated in many centralized and bureaucratic institutions making access to these funds hectic and difficult for many of these startups. Some of these startups are located in countries affected by sanctions which makes accessing the more developed world for funds to develop and grow their ideas problematic.

 Currently, there isn’t many reliable well developed decentralized platform or blockchain to help these small companies raise funds. Bech blockchain’s design specifically tackles these problems. Bech is a platform built specifically for stocks trading in its unit stablecoin Bece. These stocks issued by startup companies are backed by the services and value of these companies. Investors can then buy packs of startups or companies they trust and these startups get to raise money to fund their projects. This will help bring more influential institutional investors into blockchain technology by providing a fast and secure decentralized blockchain platform for investing in startups and companies across the globe. As more of these investors come to trust the Bech blockchain, the adoption of many forms of blockchain technology will increase in the finance industries and all other sectors.

Problem

Lack of adequate platforms that cater for Remittance outflows from Africa to other continents - further reducing capability of Africans to trade conveniently with other continents and losing out on the $480bn remittance flow to other the highly lucrative Asia, MENA (Middle East and North Africa) and LATAM (Latin American) corridors. 
The problem of Sending and Receiving payments seamlessly and securely. You don’t need to go to any bank to send or receive cross-border payments unlike other services like WorldRemit, Sendwave, Small World, Moneygram. 
Monk enables 2-way sending and receiving of transfers. You can send and receive money from any continent using any currency.

Solution

Monk is bringing cost of cross-border payment down to 0.1% (~20X cheaper than the average) saving Africans a combined $11bn in costs of moving funds in and out of the continent in a single year. (On Monk, sending $100 will cost just 10 cents as opposed to the average on other platforms which will cost upwards of $9).
Monk has built a solution where Sender or Receiver transacts 100% within the app. No need to physically go to a Bank or financial provider for any part of the transaction.

This is informed by the underdeveloped infrastructure which has made Africa a perfect vector for blockchain and cryptocurrencies, only requiring a smartphone to access blockchain networks. Africa is the second-most-populous continent in the world, with around 1.3 billion people. Due to historic issues with colonialism, civil wars, and harsh terrains, African countries have suffered from infrastructure problems for a long time. This has made financial services less accessible, leading to around 57% of the population remaining unbanked, meaning that there will be a large portion of the population moving onto the internet. According to CoinMarketCap’s Q1 2020 report on cryptocurrency adoption, Africa had the second-highest adoption of cryptocurrencies worldwide. The continent had a percentage youth growth of 91.47%, owing much to Nigeria’s 210.6% growth in young crypto users.
The project begins with a proof of concept in Kenya where the initiative will target membership in 60+ accredited universities. Based on the success of the pilot in Kenya, the template will be replicated to scale up the operations in the rest of the region drawing from lessons learned.

Ultrapods is a toolkit for decentralized identity. Here we will focus largely on DIDKit, due to the complexity of its problem space and its applicability to a wide variety of use cases. Ultrapods aims to make a useful, open, and versatile toolkit, which drives our design of each component to be modular and just complex enough to do the heavy lifting for a wide range of use cases.



DIDKit provides Verifiable Credential and Decentralized Identifier functionality across different platforms. DIDKit's core libraries are written in Rust due to Rust's expressive type system, memory safety, simple dependency web, and suitability across different platforms including embedded systems, but the comprehensive DIDKit SDK includes many libraries and interfaces for using it almost everywhere.



As more and more real-world value gets digitized over the decades, ""identity data"" has become a chokepoint for virtually all other digital value systems. Furthermore, every central repository of personal information has become a target of opportunistic business models, many of them illegal and based on exfiltration and interception of personal data. The legal spheres of so-called ""ad-tech"" and data brokerages and the illegal spheres of espionage, identity theft, and industrialized computer fraud share many characteristics.



Ultrapods is an open-source, decentralized identity platform that works openly to advance these technologies in a sustainable, standards-driven way. We share the values of the community that has been driving this technology for a decade, and we want to see it succeed in the most organic and decentralized way possible.

7232,Orgassign,0,0xCD9165FF26Ac50ec9bc3207B9d53Bc70998C6b64,"Overview

Orgassign is a contribution platform and all-in-one workspace that makes it easy for remote teams to work together, taking some of the best parts of Discord, Github and Notion while ironing out many of the major pain points.

Most DAO contributors today have to keep up with Discord + Notion + Google Docs + Github in order to figure out what they should be working on. Orgassign designed an all-in-one tool that fixed these pain points. It doesn’t bombard you with notifications like Discord, its token-gated permissions are simpler than both Notion and Google Docs, and unlike Github, it’s also designed for non-technical contributors. ‍

Orgassign helps contributors increase their efficiency by tracking tasks and goals while also providing a lasting, single point-of-reference so everyone knows what’s being worked on(and why). It manages to do all this with a tidy,intuitive interface.

Orgassign is a shared contribution space with different sections:

Roadmap - with goals, projects and tasks showing how everything fits together. Contributors are able to see a clear line between the organization’s overall goal, their team’s efforts, and their individual assignments.

Wiki - is where important information that has more permanence lives. Notes can be added to the wiki using hashtags as you are working on projects, so knowledge management is not a separate task but part of the workflow.

Groups and roles - manages what individuals can see and contribute to, which can be done through token-gating.

conclusion

Ultimately, Orgassign is designed to help you work in quite a specific way, making sure plans and tasks add up into an overarching vision(OKR style), and integrating documentation with task management. This is well-suited for DAOs because it retains historical knowledge that would otherwise be lost if individual contributors moved on, a common occurrence in the space.

A Sanskrit word, Kula, translates to “community.” For us, Kula is this, and much more. It embodies the concept of deep belonging in the world and emphasizes our relationships, not just with one another, but with all aspects of the environment (everyone and everything). Kula is about creating this sense of belonging by connecting globally across various sectors of work and engaging locally to actively reshape our future. Being part of Kula, thus, enables us as individuals to synergize and converge holistically on regenerative solutions for localized problems.

Connecting Globally, and Acting Locally

You might have noticed our honeycomb-themed branding. The honeycombs represent our communities, our Kula. Just as bees work collectively, yet individually to create honey, we, as individuals, aim to work separately, but with collective consciousness, to create holistic solutions for our Kula’s localized problems. But before we can begin to act locally, we must create a sense of deep belonging among individuals in our Kula. To do this, we will use art. Art transcends all, brings people together, and allows powerful stories to be told and heard. It also allows for the free flow of information and ideas that will help empower our civic space to continuously reimagine our future and then regeneratively recreate it. As a lateral organization, Kula will rely on art and storytelling to first, mobilize, engage, and then finally empower our community to connect globally and act locally.

Phases of Work

Phase 1: Building Our Kula
Establish and build out our global community in real life and online (the place where Kula will live)
Refine our theory of change emphasizing “connecting globally, acting locally”
Create a framework for sustainable global connection, collaboration and learning
Incorporate the usage of art as a driver for creating a civic space for social impact through an NFT drop with global artists connected to grassroots-level causes (this will be our first internal project)

Phase 2: Launching Publicly
Launch our first internal project which will help to kick off our slow-growth campaign of onboarding more local organizations and actors

Phase 3: Scaling Laterally
Allow for more internal projects to emerge through continued global and local conversations, as we scale laterally
Begin to help facilitate individuals to engage at the local level through our partnerships including initiatives, projects, and NGOs across the world
Equip the new generation of development practitioners with the skills they need to tackle grassroots-level challenges through events, workshops and learning sessions

What will funds be used for?
Paying our contributors! The work Kula aims to do is ambitious, but necessary for reshaping our future.
Supporting the livelihood of local actors that wish to engage with our partner grassroots organizations. A lot of times, essential non-profit work goes unpaid, and individuals are unable to meet their personal needs.

We bring utility to our members and engage the global crypto community to grow collaboration and support for the Brains & Builders innovating in DeSci. We are active on Twitter and in our Discord. We run bi-weekly Twitter Spaces and are deploying those into a Podcast, which can be found here. We have run 5 episodes to-date over the past two months. Project updates will be posted to our blog. 

Our Purpose
The DeSci Collective sits at the cross-section of the DeSci movement and capital innovation. Traditional science funding models are too slow, too centralized, and typically influenced by a small group of people who have the same views. Traditional science publishing models are closed systems, too siloed, not inclusive, and reward centralized institutions at the expense of the contributors. DeSci will change this. 

Idea to Market
The DeSci movement is a long-term vision to achieve the dream of open science using Web3 mechanisms and the expected exponential growth of the Web3 ecosystem. The DeSci Collective seeks to contribute to this movement in an action-oriented way as follows: 

Collective members will collaborate across DeSci and within the DeSci Collective to identify action oriented steps and projects that can be successfully achieved today that move us toward the long term vision for each of the Key DeSci Innovation Categories identified below.
The DeSci Collective will be a launchpad for DeSci builders, helping them go from Idea to Market. We will do this through (a) regular Twitter Spaces & Podcasts featuring hot topics and new projects & builders in DeSci, (b) an active community helping connect builders to talent and community members for their projects, and (c) helping to attract funding to the most promising new builders and projects, including potentially early launch grants from the DeSci Collective itself.
The DeSci Collective will be active in DeSci community building events and opportunities, including live DeSci conferences and meetups, and helping to support grant opportunities going forward, such as GitCoin DeSci grants.

Key DeSci Innovation Categories:
Democratizing scientific publishing, rewarding contributors, and incentivizing reproducibility of research results,
Funding science - for profit impact investments & research grant models,
Tokenizing Intellectual Property (e.g. IP-NFTs),
Web3 Approach for Tech Transfer,
Research data marketplaces (Data DAOs) - including negative research,
Laboratories as a Service, and
Future spaces identified by our community and innovators.

Our Guiding Principles
Transparent. We publish reports on progress and initiatives at least bi-weekly. Twitter and Discord are our primary workspaces.
Inclusive. We will make 10% of our DeSci Collective Membership Passes in each cohort freely available to students and other Brains & Builders who seek membership and demonstrate need. We also proactively seek to recruit from underrepresented communities in science.
Open. We are not beholden to any single DeSci project or umbrella. We welcome everyone and support all positive developments in the space. 
Innovative. We seek to help support Brains & Builders to launch new projects and innovations. Support can come financially, with advisory services, promotion, or otherwise. No strings attached. We aim to be the launchpad for promising projects in DeSci. 
Professional with a Crypto Edge: Our voice will be professional, credible, and constructive. However, we will also seek to include the fun and edge that has defined the broader crypto community, without diminishing credibility. We seek to do serious things while enjoying our time doing so. 

New initiatives need a strong voice at the core early-on to make decisions, operate efficiently, inspire a mission, and attract followers. We will gradually decentralize the DeSci Collective, but want to get it off to a great start with specific initiatives that will be developed by our team at Cherubim Labs with strong input from the DeSci Collective community.

With Pyme, we aim to onboard and empower the next billion users to web3 by providing everyone with opportunities.


""Big Statement,"" and rightfully so!
Pyme, as you see it today, is just one step in our massive pursuit and ambitions of personal data ownership, data monetization opportunities, web3 accessibility, and a composable, chain-agnostic, decentralized social identity. 

Since our launch, we have offered over 70,000+ verified users the opportunity to use their data to earn over 220,000+ rewards through quests on Pyme alone.


Am I late?
No, you're early! There are new incredible quests on Pyme from the coolest companies and projects. Complete these quests and claim these rewards for yourself.

And companies, you're not late either! Pyme is your opportunity to run campaigns with accurate predictive results. Run campaigns based on on-chain and off-chain verified actions. Reward your users directly for their data and participation.


What are our plans?
As we continue to grow, these are the milestones that we're working on at Pyme. 

Going Multi-Chain
We believe the future of the web3 space is multi-chain. Therefore, Pyme is integrating new blockchains such as AURORA to expand our support to many more projects and companies alongside accessibility for users from the newer blockchains.

Singular Web3 Identity
Connecting your wallet to every platform is already a challenge. But, then, add in the extra effort of sharing data across projects. That's exhausting.

That's why we are working on a single, multi-chain web3 identity. With granular control of your data points, you can conveniently add, remove, control, and share your data. Leveraging the power of protocols such as Unlock, provide timed, restricted access to your data to selected users or even to other projects and companies.

Here’s an example: Own an ENS Domain? Connect your ENS domain to your data points to get access to quests which require the user to have a configured ENS domain.

Projects can utilize our SDK to request permissions from the user and get access. Projects no longer need to create extensive systems to collect, store or integrate data points. The SDK will allow on-demand access based on the permissions set by the user.

Verification and Membership Tiers
Web3 Projects have a botting problem. Just like any other platform, we've had to face the same. Currently, Pyme combats botting with the help of basic non-intrusive methods to verify the humanity of its users. Yet, we realize that this is not enough.

Therefore, we are building out different verification tiers for users on Pyme. 

Verification levels will allow users to earn better rewards and access better quests on Pyme based on their verification levels. Tying in with the singular web3 identity, you can prove your humanity and trust with your verification tier that you can choose to share with other projects and dapps in the space.

About one quarter (25%) of Black Americans own crypto, and when examining investors under the age of 40, that number jumps to 38%. According to the data, 15% of white investors own crypto, and 29% are under 40. According to Entrepreneur Magazine, Black investors were more than twice as likely (11%) to name crypto as their first investment compared to white investors (4%). This means that on average when Bitcoin dropped, yet again this group was on the frontlines of a catastrophe. In my own research (yo soy @Monica_DRRProf) I have found that despite the fact that Black and Latino communities are overexposed to climate and socio-economic degeneration, they are underexposed to the potential benefits of ReFi and DeFi. 

The Undivide Project wants to host a three-part workshop resulting in training and a clear set of policy recommendations for making DEIA a core part of new Web 3.0 and related crypto regulations. Here are the details: Part 1) Blockchain and Web 3.0 primer, Part 2) Crypto scams versus Crypto opportunities, and Part 3) ReFi and Defi for community upliftment. Each workshop will have a feedback loop about the experiences of the participants in the space. We will take that feedback and make \""DEIA for Web 3.0\"" and ReFi policy recommendations based on the best kind of science, and people's lived experiences. I as the founder of the organization and a former Hill staffer will take personal responsibility for seeing these recommendations through. \n\nBecause of the particular overexposure of the Black community to bad crypto deals and lack of access to information about ReFi, DeFi, and the positive aspects of Web 3.0, we will focus on that group immediately but will offer open access to our workshops and depending on funding, offer Spanish language translations. 

To accomplish our goals, we need to raise $10K.

7248,High-tech Quantum Biology: tweaking endogenous quantum degrees of freedom in biology towards theranostics,0,0xA2abF6F00566271eBc3b888ea0c821FAA45D6126,"Imagine driving cell activities to treat injuries and disease simply by using tailored magnetic fields (MFs). Many disease markers, such as: the production of reactive oxygen species during adult stem cell-mediated regeneration; epigenetic changes to induce pluripotency; cell fate decisions in embryonic stem cells; and cell differentiation of adult stem cells were demonstrated to be controlled by weak MFs (with a strength on the order of that produced by your cell phone), very likely via the electron quantum property of ""spin"". Although exciting, these data are correlative, and the functional relevance of such quantum effects in biology remains unclear. Research has not been able to track spin states to manipulate physiological outcomes in vivo and in real time, without which the potential game-changing clinical benefits of ""quantum signaling"" cannot be realized in the long-term. The goal of this proposal is to, within an accelerated timeline, design and build novel instrumentation to directly measure and control both spin states and their biological consequences at the same time, leveraging our expertise in quantum instrumentation building.

Spin is an intrinsic quantum property of electrons and some atomic nuclei; it describes how quantum particles interact with magnetic fields. Since such spins make organisms behave, for a short time, as ""living quantum sensors"", we employ established quantum techniques borrowed from the field of technological quantum sensing. The unusual crossover between experimental quantum sensing, developmental biology, and theoretical spin physics is the fundamental strength of our proposal. Combining quantum-inspired instrumentation, theory predictions, and cell bioengineering, we will systematize knowledge on how organisms use endogenous quantum degrees of freedom to function, in an effort to exert control over such phenomena towards a desired physiological outcome.

In the long run, the fine-tuning of endogenous ""quantum knobs"" existing in nature will enable the development of drugs and therapeutic devices that could heal the human body via the interaction with weak magnetic fields. A long-term goal is thus to harness spin quantum degrees of freedom to commandeer and drive physiology. Instrumentation we will develop include:

1) Microscopes coupled to coils and radio-frequency microchips, where specimens (from proteins to both invertebrate and vertebrate cells) will be systematically perturbed by weak magnetic fields. Mid-XX century scientists harnessed the signal provided by biological spins in magnetic resonance imaging – a technology that, to this day, is used for diagnostics. Here, we will go further and influence spins through magnetic resonance to effect treatment. In contrast to magnetic resonance imaging, our technology relies upon very weak fields (the underlying physical mechanism being different). Our technology will lead to remotely actuated, personalized medicine devices that can predictably alter disease progression using weak magnetic fields.

2) An electrophysiology setup coupled to coils and radio-frequency microchips where the following hypothesis can be tested. We hypothesize that spin-dependent chemical reactions happening within the cellular membrane might influence the functioning of ion channels; and that, conversely, transient ion fluxes inside the cell might produce weak magnetic fields to tweak widespread spin-dependent chemical reactions. Optogenetics relies on laser excitation to control the opening and closing of ion channels in genetically modified cells. Here, with tailored, weak magnetic field excitation and no genetic modification, we posit it might be possible to deterministically affect ion channel functioning – with myriad applications for neurological control.

3) A scanning tunneling microscope coupled to coils and radio-frequency microchips will help decipher why, at room temperature, charge transport through chiral biomolecules favors one spin (""chiral-induced spin selectivity"", observed first in DNA and α-helices and presently harnessed in spintronics). Recently, electron transport through a live bacterium nanowire was demonstrated to have such a spin preference, suggesting there is a possibility that other electron transport processes in biology – most importantly, cellular respiration – might also exhibit such a spin preference. From a physics point of view, this is highly unusual – for ex., a quantum computer needs to spend precious resources to prepare electrons that favor one spin. Knowing how transport of electronic ""quantum information"" happens inside chiral biomolecules such as DNA enables the toolkit of quantum physics to be explored towards the control of such quantum information. In practice, this means that quantum methods that control spins via engineered magnetic fields could be applied to tweak physiological processes dependent on electron transport.

To sum up, the work will bridge the outstanding gap between the theoretical mechanisms of quantum spin effects in biology and the phenomenological evidence of MF effects on cellular behavior, through novel quantum-inspired instrumentation. We will establish unambiguous links between spin-dependent chemical pathways and in vivo metabolism, signaling and cellular physiology. Pushing the frontiers of Quantum Biology, our project will systematically study spins within cells across multiple scales (quantum, molecular, cellular and physiological), visualizing the manipulation of, for ex., regeneration by weak MFs in both vertebrates and invertebrates. We will, for the first time, both measure and control spins within living organisms to influence the regenerative process – with nanoscale resolution and without the need to manipulate genes. A physicist could describe our approach as the ""coherent control of light-matter interactions, where matter is biomatter"". Having nanoscale electromagnetic handles onto cellular processes will enable the monitoring and selective stimulation or suppression of cellular functions that are electromagnetic in nature. For ex., MFs could be applied in situ in order to reduce uncontrolled reactive oxygen species proliferation; and electron signaling and transport through proteins could be made pathologically weak or strong. A long-term goal is thus to master organismic behavior and metabolic function via the control of native electromagnetic-responsive pathways, using tailored, weak magnetic field excitation.

Can quantum spin physics be established – or refuted! – to account for physiologically relevant biological phenomena, and be manipulated to technological and therapeutic advantage? This is the broad, exciting question addressed by this proposal.

Justification for need of #DeSci external support

The current bottleneck in spin-mediated quantum biology is the lack of high-tech instrumentation that can directly prepare, control and measure endogenous quantum degrees of freedom in biology as if they were bona fide quantum objects (because they are!). Our proposal addresses this bottleneck in that: 1) it is grounded on instrumentation that applies ‘quantum coherent control’ (i.e., engineered MFs) onto biomatter; and 2) predictions and quantum simulations drive the hybrid quantum biological experiments (in contrast to biophysics studies in which phenomena are modeled after observation).

This frontier field is not yet recognized by governmental funding agencies, and not yet relevant to disease foundations. Even with paradigm-altering potential benefits, attempts to fund similar cutting edge projects have been consistently labelled too ‘biological’ for engineering mechanisms, too ‘engineering’ for biological ones, and completely out of interest scope by NIH. Moreover, costs and timelines are aligned with those of quantum physics experimental setup development (namely, ∼ $1–1.5mi per setup, over a build time of 2–3
years) and as such deemed ‘too steep/too slow’ by usual biophysics standards.

With medium-term sustained support (5–7 years) of our deeply interwoven physics/biology/theory operation, we expect not only to realize and share with the quantum biology community enabling instrumentation, but also to showcase initial results that can catapult spin-based quantum biology into a mainstream-fundable area. Present technology in wearables and miniaturization will already suffice to produce tailored, weak MFs that actuate personalized ‘quantum therapeutics’ in the future. In turn, knowledge generated by experiments to deterministically map ‘quantum causes’ to ‘physiological outcomes’ (such as those we will perform) will realistically require at least 1–2 decades of maturation until therapeutic deployment. However, without such a sustained support, efforts to develop the required quantum biological technology and incentives for young talent to join the field will both remain distressingly nonexistent.",Valid Ethereum Address.

Societify is a guild management platform for sharing player accounts and assets across the Web3 gaming ecosystem.

Societify enables players to share access to fellow guild members about their on-chain features, which leverages NFTs,gamefi and soulbound tokens.

Societify can be used to

Support newbies and the guild community
Help a friend to maintain his gaming profile while he is on a break
Share skills between groups of friends to help everyone focus on their strengths



Societify is an on-chain EVM compatible protocol that utilizes NFTs, soul bound tokens, smart contract systems and multi-sig wallets to ensure safety and user trust.

User accounts are Gnosis-safes, and we use wallet-connect and the Gnosis safe mobile app to log into any on-chain game safely and efficiently.

Each Gnosis safe holds all in-game assets, and ensures role based access while protecting core control of all assets.



The smart contracts on Societify are wrapped in a clean and usable frontend interface to ensure equal and easy access to Societify.

The Ethereum Name System is used to give names to guilds and access human-readable player information throughout the Guild System.

IPFS is used to both host the web application using Fleek, and also any media assets such as guild images or profile photos.

Societify is deployed on several blockchains such as Polygon, Optimism, and Gnosis Chain to ensure broad access to the Web3 gaming ecosystem.",Valid Ethereum Address. 
7253,How to Define Your Personal Writing Style,0,0xb794f5ea0ba39494ce839613fffba74279579268,"You've heard of repetition, but what does it mean? Repetition is a tricky subject, and it's hard to define. But it is important for networking purposes. Here are a few tips to help you figure out whether you're using repetition properly. First, embrace your changes. The process of defining your voice and style is like defining your values, beliefs, and priorities. It takes practice and dedication.

Repetition is a controversial topic

In your writing style, you may find repetition to be useful or detrimental. In some instances, repetition serves a purpose, such as reinforcing key ideas or conveying rhythm. However, repetition should never be used solely to pad the word count. If used properly, repetition can make your writing sparkle.

While repeated words and phrases may not be a part of your writing style, they can help make a text more memorable and meaningful. 
In paper writing help online, repetition can be used in many forms, from a single word or line to a whole sentence. It can help emphasize important ideas, convey a sense of rhythm, and enhance your audience's reading experience.

It's hard to define

There's no right or wrong way to write, and your style will reflect your personality and your writing abilities. But the best way to define your writing style is to let it develop naturally out of your personality. For example, don't try to write like Hemingway or Tom Wolfe. Their style is interesting for its parody, but it sounds forced. Instead, write in a way that reflects your natural style and expresses your individuality.

It's difficult to improve

Improving your writing style is not easy, but there are a few things you can do to help yourself improve your style. The first step is to read and study your favorite writers' work. It will help you see how they use various techniques to make their writing interesting and engaging. The second step is to practice writing more, and you will eventually discover your style and voice.

It's important for networking

If you want to create a strong following, you need to interact on social media. This means responding to tweets and posts, challenging opinions, and listening to others. You should also offer your expertise and give people your time. This will help them form an opinion of you and help them to decide whether to follow you or not.

It's important for marketing

Whether you're writing for yourself or as part of a marketing campaign, your writing style can make or break your marketing efforts. It should be well-organized, concise, and contain a solid sense of substance. Writing should also be relevant and substantive, and be written with your target audience in mind.

Many elements contribute to your writing style, including the words you use, the formality of your writing, and your vocabulary choice. 

Style is an important part of communicating with your target audience, and it should be consistent across your communications. Depending on your audience, you may need to use different styles, including a formal tone, a more informal voice, and visual representation.

For each transaction, we use The Twisted ElGamal scheme/Vector Commitment to encrypt the amount or input data for ERC20/ERC721 and use mixed proof system to generate the TX validity proof (signature, range proof, balance audibility, etc.). the sequencer will run a chain-BFT to reach the consensus of the next batch of transactions and submit the Merkle root of the transaction batch to Rollup Contract. Once the provers watched a new transaction Merkle root, it fetches the transaction from the node and generates the block validity proof on the Account Merkle Tree. Once the proof is generated, it submits to the Rollup Contract, and the Rollup Contract will verify the proof with the new Account Merkle Tree root and its TX tree root as the public input. If it's a valid proof, Rollup Contract will return the deposit and another reward to the prover.

Our demo : https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9F-NHXRY4HY.






We provide EIP-level compatibility, which means we provide privacy-preserving ERC20, ERC7and 21, Swap interfaces.

The accountability is naturally supported in our scheme with a range limit of amount for every single transaction.

Our mixed ZKP system is being built on FRI and KZG arguments, to achieve no trusted setup on the user-end, and constant proof size with low gas cost on L1 verifier contracts. We had built the prototype on our eigen-zkit. We first implemented the Javascript/NodeJS bellman prover, and use this prover to generate proof for encrypted TX and rollup block. In the near future, we will replace our TX'es proof system with FRI, and generates the final block validity proof by Plonk.

7229,Coffee Carbon Collective: regenerative financing for coffee farmers,0,0x3Cc9F396430bC766AC8aa57fc28aeBc5919A5d81,"We are participating in the Consensus Hackathon - web3athon - and will have our first prototype released on 20th September 2022. We will accumulate the learnings in a GitBook and share them with the grant supporters. Stay tuned!

About:
Coffee Carbon Collective (CCC) is a project born in May 2022 during ReFi DAO hackathon. CCC creates a solution to provide pre-financing to coffee farmers and transition to generative agriculture.

Problem:
Rising temperatures are going to reduce the area suitable for growing coffee by up to 50% by 2050.


Coffee farmers suffer from climate change affecting their farmers and recognize the urge to transition to agroforestry to protect their farms and future. You can read more about agroforestry here.
During the last months, we spoke to more than 50 farmers in Colombia, Costa Rica, Guatemala, and Brazil. We also did 25 face-to-face interviews at World of Coffee (the largest coffee industry event, June 2022) and talked to 20 coffee, regenerative agriculture, and carbon project development professionals:
100% of coffee farmers suffer from climate change already now (drought, shifting seasons, pests & diseases).
93% of interviewed coffee farmers recognize the need to transition to regenerative agriculture and consider agroforestry the only viable solutions
Transition to agroforestry takes 4-5 years and requires financial and human resources. Crop volume drops short-term, and farmers need to have the security of revenues.
Right now smallholder farmers (3-5 ha) are not able to get certified to sell carbon credits (certification cost 50k and is financially feasible for 1000ha farms).
Smallholders are ready to act, but the absence of pre-financing tools and safety nets stops them from switching to regenerative agriculture and sequestering carbon at their farms already now!

Solution:
CCC provides a web3 AI-enabled ecosystem to support coffee farmers in transitioning to agroforestry by providing tools for pre-financing and tools for direct trade with climate-conscious coffee buyers.
Farmer enrolls into agroforestry transition program with CCC, CCC quantifies future carbon savings and mints a geo-spatial NFT that keeps the track of regeneration of the farm. Farmer requests pre-financing of transition by issuing carbon credit tokens that are connected to geospatial NFTs using CCC infrastructure and fundraising directly from the climate-conscious buyers. CCC guides the farmer through transition and keeps the track of activities, verifies practices and results through dMRV. CCC provides another set of contracts for the direct coffee trade to open market access for ""regenerated coffee"".
We believe that there is a great opportunity to build a solution for insetting, not offsetting. There is a strong commitment of traders and roasters to reducing the carbon footprint of coffee production and a strong will to support the farmers they work with. However, like any carbon credit buyer, they need transparency and accountability. We are developing our solution on Celo and Filecoin, using a dMRV infrastructure like dMeter or MRV Collective.

Impact:
There are 10.2 million ha of coffee land worldwide, 84% of coffee is grown under sun in mono-crop farms and only 16% on average - shade or agroforestry grown. You can read about the impact of agroforestry systems here.



Carbon sequestration potential (carbon stock) for agroforestry-grown coffee is 6.5 tons/ha in comparison to 2.6 tons/ha with conventional production. Check out more here. At the moment coffee producing areas sequester 32,508,898.50 tons of carbon, but switching to agroforestry has the potential to sequester 34,204,306.50 tons more! Check out calculations here.
Besides, switching to agroforestry will mean:
Improves farmers’ livelihood: it allows farmers to produce food, fodder, fuel, and timber from farmland - up to 20% more revenue
Reduce amounts of fertilizers: tree-rich farming systems reduce the application of nitrogen fertilizer - lower costs of production
Increase biodiversity by growing various species at the coffee farms
Improve productivity: Trees in the croplands improve productivity and create carbon sinks - growing coffee and carbon revenues
Prevent deforestation: Tropical deforestation is responsible for 25% of the net annual CO2 emissions worldwide
Improve farmers’ resilience to extreme weather, especially drought and frost

Roadmap:
Stage 1: Prototype & Methodology (September - December 2022) - GR15 funding
Prototype of the carbon sequestration methodology - data collection from farmers and analysis, modeling resources necessary for farm transition, incl. financial, labor, and the time required for transition, calculator of pre-financing needed based on farmer’s data
Prototype onboarding UI for farmers - No-code UI for data collection, farm state visualization, carbon sequestration calculation for farmers, and NFT minting
Implement NFTs and carbon tokens - Farm-specific geospatial non-sellable NFTs with information like location, carbon info, ERC20 tokens for pre-financing of regeneration, NFTs for seasonal coffee purchasing as in the form of an agreement

We are participating in the Consensus Hackathon - web3athon - and will have our first prototype released on 20th September 2022. We will accumulate the learnings in a GitBook and share them with the grant supporters. Stay tuned!

Stage 2: Build a community & Develop dMRV (January - June 2023)
Improve our carbon sequestration prediction methodology and model various scenarios of farm regeneration based on the initial state and most optimal path to traditional polyculture
Onboard farmers in Colombia and Brazil, build an in-field support operation through existing cooperatives and freelance agronomists, and prototype and test farmer support programs and agroforestry guides. Onboard roasters and coffee carbon investors on the platform test their demand and wishes
Develop fully-functional dMRV solution for agroforestry in cooperation with the research institutions, agroforestry practitioners, and existing digital MRV solutions (eg. dMeter, MRV Collective)

Stage 3: Launch operations & Form a DAO (July - December 2023)
Launch full-scale operations in Colombia and Brazil
Form a DAO for farmers and funders

We are committed to building a solution that benefits coffee farmers and funders, as well as the entire ReFi community. The methodology we develop will be made open source and accessible to anyone who needs it. We will make our learnings from the field projects and working with funders public and accessible for other regenerators.

7228,Grassland: Free Robotic Intelligence and Analytics for the Physical World,0,0x757802FBDD0EA9d92B7e9568aAc111c35303b417,"We're building a decentralised, global AI that transforms the world into a giant blockchain. It lets any developer give any internet connected machine complete awareness of real life environments regardless of economic, geographic or political barriers. It democratizes surveillance and artificial intelligence by putting it back into the hands of everyday people.




An API for Apps & Smart Contracts
The P2P network's censorship-resistant and permissionless API lets 3rd-party applications and smart contracts query, locate, and respond immediately to physical changes in any tangible asset around the world. The entire blockchain is free for anyone to access. 

Decentralised Autonomous Intelligence
Each computer vision software client forms part of a decentralised autonomous intelligence that incentivizes its expansion across the globe by paying miners to reveal all the ""dark"" areas on its map of the world. No one owns or controls the network and anyone can take part.


Scientific Data of the Physical World
Grassland's blockchain is a live, digital twin of the real world that anyone can access. In addition to regular wallet address, its blockchain has binary coordinate addresses that are long enough to encode every object-event within 7.5 billion KM* over the next 400 years. It's computer vision can process video streams from optical or thermal cameras, whether they're terrestrial or satellite cams. Which means that researchers can get analytical data about both the past and present states of the physical world and human interactions, including the spread of diseases, as well as real-time information on even the tiniest environmental changes taking place anywhere this decentralized AI's awareness has expanded to. 


A New Geospatial Blockchain: Creating a Tamper-Resistant History of the Physical World
  - The AI regulates and bankrolls its own expansion to produce a tamper-resistant history of the physical world that anyone can freely access 
  - Its binary addresses are long enough to encode every object-event within 7.5 billion KM* over its 400 year block reward schedule
  - Captures basic 3D features to prioritize real-time intelligence over photorealism (compression ratio of >2000:1 over the original video)
  - Clients are ""localized""; computation and compression always scales with the network's size
  - Teaches itself the correct relationships between object-events regardless of human intervention 

Trustless Intelligence Gathering
It'll always work the way it's supposed to whether or not the participants (individuals, companies, governments, etc.) trust or even know each other. Like the internet, no one owns or controls it. Anyone can participate.



Block Reward
The AI compensates miners for their computer vision. There's no token (or NFT). It's the Grassland blockchain's native coin. It has to be because computer vision requires computation, hence you can't get away from PoW. And Grassland's PoW is specifically designed for AI's. This PoW is also eco-friendly since it doesn't need arbitrary hashing. It lets the network thwart spam and DDoS attacks so it can provide valid, life saving intelligence.

The block reward itself is split up among all the miners. They each get a piece of the ""pie"". And only 21 million coins will ever be mined.

Upcoming Feature
Region Bounties is a native smart contract that will make it easy for everyone to get real-time digital twins of the parts of the world that they want.

Do you want to use your crypto to support a dream? To help an entrepreneur build and expand their business? A Crypto UBI to support Delano for one month in diversifying his agricultural business will cost $80. To help Sheila upgrade and expand her Tuck-Shop for one year, $960. To help kickstart and grow ten businesses for 12 months,  $9 600.

Be part of their journey and follow the stories of African entrepreneurs using a crypto basic income to pursue their dreams, grow their businesses and improve their lives. 

All funds raised through Gitcoin, big or small, will go directly to participants! 

Building an accessible, efficient and transparent financial system starts with challenging some popular beliefs. These include poverty being a personal choice, people not being able to manage their finances, and a job being a sure way out of poverty. By deploying a free-to-use digital currency, GoodDollar,  in a small town, we want to show that this is not true. 

There are so many creative, talented and skilled individuals in rural towns across South Africa. They make a living and run businesses with little support from authorities and the formal financial sector. These individuals are true entrepreneurs in every sense of the word but are hampered by limited access to resources and insufficient funds. As a result, multimillion-rand industries and opportunities go unrecognised. 

RightfulShare wants to show that a basic income can stimulate entrepreneurship and innovation. Doing so digitally is more effective and opens up more learning and business opportunities. 

RoadMap Pilot 1:
1.Discovery and Design - In progress 2022
2.Launch - January 2023
3.Distribution of Crypto UBI (GoodDollar) to the value of $80 pm per person - February 2023 - February 2024
4.Completion of Analysis - March 2024
5.Release of Documentary - May 2024

Key Objectives:
1.Grassroots Organisation: Organise basic income supporters to lead the movement at a local, provincial and national level grounding the work in the local experiences of micro-entrepreneurs and creators.

2.Thought Leadership: Practically illustrate how to onboard previously disadvantaged groups into Web3 at scale and educate South Africans on basic income using stories and evidence generated by the pilot. 

3.Political Impact: Advocate for legislative change to facilitate crypto adoption and direct cash transfers to non-disabled working-age adults.

Comprehensive Budget overview Pilot 1
Direct cash transfers (aligned to the Upper-Bound Poverty Line in SA) to 100 beneficiaries in GoodDollars - $96k
Operations, marketing and filming of documentary - $83k

On the other hand, the aggregator uses all liquidity pools in any network and offers the lowest slippage to the user.

How is that possible?
Well, in Cashmere, assets to be traded on the source chain use the aggregator to find the best offer on the source chain, asset swaps to stablecoin, and stablecoin is locked on the source chain by Cashmere. With its own liquidity pools and interoperability messaging protocol, Cashmere allows users in the target chain to withdraw equal stablecoin from pools.

By leveraging transformers – the same neural network architecture used to train OpenAI’s DALL-E 2 & GPT-3 – LION will build on classical approaches to language and communication analysis through the lens of a single, open source system.

 
What is LION?
L.I.O.N is an acronym for linguistic informatics for organizational networks.
 
The LION project intends to develop an open source bridge for communication data processing [starting with Discord] and a pipeline for model training and deployment.
 
Contributor activity will be analyzed ethically and privacy-preserving. Aggregate analytics will be measured against established metrics of well-being, such as likert-scale questionnaires. The core objective of LION is the hosting of a production-ready service developed with privacy-preserving best practices and ultimately, the publishing of a research article about findings.
 
It is built on the concepts of Organizational Network Analysis [ONA] and Natural Language Processing [NLP] as approaches to modeling organizational communication networks. Like social network analysis, ONA produces a graph that visualizes and measures the strength of relationships between nodes. It has been used to model the interactions between an organization’s members and predict burnout from measures like collaborative overload. Together with NLP tools like spaCy and empath, they have uncovered psychometrics like engagement, turnover intent, and cultural fit.
 
We expect LION will improve our understanding of communication and coordination within digitally native organizations.
 
Grant funds will be used to cover stipends for open-source contributors to the project.

Privacy is normal and everywhere in 2022. Signal, FaceTime and iMessage are end-to-end encrypted, https encrypts website traffic, and Zcash encrypts crypto transactions.

However, E-mail is still sent unencrypted. It is stored unencrypted on your device and mail servers.

There are existing solutions like PGP, but they are hard to use. Even the PGP inventor himself doesn’t use it anymore. That’s why we created OpenPGC: Open Pretty Good Crypto.

OpenPGC is a new blockchain-agnostic standard that uses existing crypto keys to encrypt and sign e-mail. The signing and encrypting happens off-chain, so there are no gas fees for sending OpenPCG-encrypted e-mail.

The user is in control. OpenPGC is non-custodial and uses existing self-sovereign identity protocols to link keys with identities. For example, you can send e-mails to ENS domains:


Openness is OpenPGC’s strength. This not only enables the users to choose the blockchain(s) or identity protocol(s) they prefer, it also allows OpenPGC to continuously improve as blockchains and identity protocols evolve. This process is nearly impossible with fixed siloed standards such as PGP.

Stop phishing attacks
A major result of using OpenPGC would be a great reduction in phishing attacks. If all e-mails were signed with our Ethereum keys, phishing would be a lot harder.

Demo available
We have created a technical demo called Moonfish that demonstrates how unobtrusive a crypto-based privacy solution can be. Users can continue to use their existing e-mail addresses, existing e-mail servers and existing e-mail client. It's so easy, it's hard to believe it's crypto. Contact us for a TestFlight invite (macOS-only for now).


What's next?
The current OpenPGC implementation intentionally follows existing standards as closely as possible, such as RFC-4880 (openPGP), EIP-1024 (Cross-client Encrypt/Decrypt) and EIP 712 (Typed structured data hashing and signing). However, the current standardizations efforts are falling short and are unable to support where the ecosystem is moving. Therefore, OpenPGC is leading an effort to standardize safer and more versatile encryption and signing of messages and files. This grant enables us to improve OpenPGC and work together with cryptographers and wallet developers to create an important blockchain-agnostic privacy standard.

NebullaX is dedicated to building the infrastructure to empower a fully transparent and collaborative credential data network, in a bid to help Web3 developers better their products and communities. In return, data creators who contribute to our credential data network will have earns once the data are utilized.



Credentials are important due to the high use case they provide. Applications can use your credentials to calculate credit scores, find target audiences, reward community contributors, etc. With the advance of Web3 and DAOs, there will be an explosion of behavioral data generated by the waves of new users. Hence, there will be a great demand for infrastructure to help these new users build digital credentials that will be of vital importance.



At present days, credential data are divided by closed databases that are owned and permitted by applications, government departments and financial/credit institutions, etc. These result in a fractured landscape that separates the owners of data from being the users of the data. NebullaX aim to solve this problem by creating an open and collaborative credential data network, which ultimately will motivate more users to build better products and/or user communities.



NebullaX aims to build an open, secure and collaborative credential data network that is accessible to all end-users/developers in Web3. With providing the infrastructure for community members to curate and contribute digital credentials to our data network, we support curating credentials through multiple data sources.. For on-chain credentials, curators can contribute with subgraph queries or static snapshots. For off-chain credentials, we have integrated with data sources such as Twitter, and Github.

By contributing to NebullaX’s Credential Data Network, curators are rewarded when credentials are used in NebullaX’s Application Modules, Credential Oracle Engine, and Credential API. As users are willing to pay to use data in our system, incentives will be accumulated to reward curators.",Valid Ethereum Address.

Please read our Technical Whitepaper or the References to know more about us. Some brief content will be shown here, TL;DR.
 
What is zkPass
zkPass is a decentralized KYC solution based on MPC (Multi-Party Computation) and ZKP (Zero-Knowledge Proof), which aims to overcome the various flaws in the current KYC system, eliminate the pain points related to identity authentication, and protect user privacy while expanding KYC capabilities.
 
Key Features
Generality: Individual users can generate and reuse their identity multiple times, and their information will not be leaked to any third party throughout the multi-party interaction.
Customization: Enterprise users can select and configure KYC templates on demand to meet KYC needs in different dimensions, while the verifying party knows nothing about the data.
Privacy-preserving: Strong data privacy-preserving is achieved through MPC (interaction session) and ZKP (proof session), while the parties to the agreement have no knowledge of the data.
Compatibility: zkPass protocol is backward compatible and widely adapted to the current data source protocol, while the data source has no knowledge of the data destination.
Decentralization: The zkPass protocol is completely decentralized as there is no centralized service to store sensitive user data.
 
zkPass’ Solutions
zkPass Protocol: A decentralized open source protocol consisting of Transport Layer Security, Multi-Party Computation, Zero Knowledge Proof and other technologies. It is run by zkPass Node to build a decentralized Verifier that participates in the three-party TLS protocol.
zkPass Kit: Build a Prover for the three-party TLS protocol on top of the TCP layer alongside the Https layer, in the form of a plugin/SDK. Business users select or customize a suitable KYC template according to their needs, configure the template into zkPass Kit in the form of parameters, and initiate KYC requests to the smart contract on blockchain.
Smart Contract: 1)Template: Store templates and related parameters to prevent Verifier from cheating.2)Task: Assign tasks to specify MPC participants to prevent Verifier from conspiring.3)ZK Verification: verify ZKP to prevent user privacy leakage.

Madaland is an operating system for crypto native organizations or DAOs.

It provides everything an organization needs to operate on-chain: Payments, Teams, Authority, Governance, Fundraising, Revenue sharing, Arbitration, and the ability to interact with any other smart contract on Ethereum.
When creating a DAO, you’ll need to manage many operational aspects. Users can either find a tool to handle each different aspect ( one tool to track contributions, one tool to manage compensation,etc.) or use an all-in-one solution like Madaland.

Anyone who wants to set up a DAO can use the primitives that are pre-built within Madaland:

Define structure: Domains divide your Madaland into teams, units, circles, projects, or any configuration that makes sense for your organization.
Distribute authority: Permissions give individuals, groups, or even apps custom decision authority in each Domain.
Allocate budgets: Domains can directly manage the funds allocated to them, balancing autonomy with oversight.
Coordinate work: Define, incentivize, and coordinate delivery of the product or process that provides your organization’s value.
Streamline payments: Madaland simplifies compensation complexity whether your organization compensates contributors via tips, salaries, or revenue-sharing.‍
Quantify performance: Earn Reputation for contributions.

There are so many tools out there that exist to make DAO creation & management smooth and efficient that it can be overwhelming. Instead of combining dozens of individual tools, which also makes the onboarding of new contributors more complex. Madaland empowers users with one end-to-end solution.",Valid Ethereum Address.

7225,Commons Credit Working Group organized by ReCommon,0,0xd704C5F9826191F3Bd06caE867d0f20CAfA8AeBA," ""The story of land is older than the story of man. Land came first; no man created it. Every society, large or small, must devise ways in which its members will share this gift.""
- Robert Swann, Schumacher Center for New Economics
 
The commodification and privatization of land support debt cycles that promote extractive and unsustainable practices.

At ReCommon Foundation, we facilitate the reclamation and stewardship of common land by supporting resilient place-based economies and regenerative cultures.


A new credit methodology for the commons

We propose to use grant funds to create an interdisciplinary working group to research and develop a methodology for a “Commons Credit,” a new credit class within the larger stack of ReFi credit classes. This working group will be organized and sponsored by ReCommon Foundation (previously Regenerative Community Land Trust) with input from partner organizations such as Basin DAO and Center for CLT Innovation. 

Once developed and launched, this Commons Credit will quantify and allow for the sale of the certified impact created by the de-privatization of land - i.e. the purchasing of a piece of property or Real World Asset (RWA), removing it from the speculative market, and bringing it into the commons for perpetual ownership and stewardship by the community. The working group’s research would explore what would qualify as a “commons,” what the economic, environmental, and social impacts of bringing land into the commons are, and what is the best methodology for quantifying and valuing the sum of these impacts in a way that empowers local land stewards and also creates trust and transparency for impact investors. 




Methodology research and development

This research would have three phases: 

The first phase would be an evaluation of the relevant literature and work that has been done in quantifying the impact of bringing lands into the commons and commons management. This phase would look at the environmental, social, and economic impacts of removing land from private ownership models and returning them into the commons, and the various ownership structures that could qualify as “commons.” 

The second phase of research would be the development of a proposed methodology of what would qualify a land-based project for a commons credit, with specific exploration of how Elinor Ostram’s 8 principles for managing a commons can be deployed for the ensuring success of the Commons Credit system. It would look at real-world examples of “commons creation” and examine the challenges and successes of these examples to inform the methodology.

The third phase of research would be the publication of a report and a proposed methodology for the Commons Credit system. We would put this report out to the larger ReFi community, environmental stewardship and conservation groups around the globe and ask for feedback based on their experience. This feedback process would allow a “ground truthing” to occur- ensuring that the proposed methodology is grounded in the real-world context and challenges that community-stewarded land projects face. 


Building a community around commons preservation

Throughout our research process, we will hold weekly Twitter spaces to allow the greater ReFi communities to benefit from our learnings. This type of learning in public also allows for questions and insights to be gathered from the larger ReFi ecosystem, and creates a dialectic relationship between community-wide learning and knowledge production. This would benefit both the larger ReFi community and the quality of the final report and proposed methodology. On these Twitter spaces, we may host certain influential thinkers/academics whom we are learning from in that phase of our research. 

This working group will include the following researchers:
-Charlie Fisher: Center for Community Land Trust Innovation and PhD student at the Oxford Brookes Program studying the intersection of the commons and web 3. 
-Anna-Marie Swan: Team member at Regens Unite and Nestr, and ReCommon DAO contributor who brings expertise in collaborative governance structures and the commons. 
-Thomas Morgan (TMO) will be acting as a strategic advisor to the working group. BasinDAO founder, working on RWA founders circle and RWA Report for Climate Collective, as well as the BasinDAO eco-credit methodology.
-Sebastian Rodriguez-Larrain: Impact-Driven Photographer, Celo Foundation Ambassador, and President of Regenera Peru.
-Colleen Cummings: PhD at University of Denver student studying transformative and regenerative practices, community organizing, and collective action.
-Charlie Dubbe: Executive director of ReCommon, 10 years of experience in regenerative agriculture. Studied the impact of the commons and patterns of privatization at UC Berkeley School of Geography. 
-Alex Corren: Co-founder and Board President of ReCommon. His background is in environmental science, focusing on water resources and regenerative systems design.
-Chris Giersch: Chief of Operations at ReCommon. Chris has a background in coding and development and is the organizational backbone of the foundation. 
-Matthew Lawley: Director of Marketing and Communications at ReCommon. Outside of his work with ReCommon, Matt is  a skilled permaculture designer and farmer.


Accelerating climate impact from the ground up

The creation of a Commons Credit methodology has the potential for significant impact in accelerating climate action. This Commons Credit will act as an economic engine for on-the-ground communities that are engaging in regenerative land stewardship practices on communally owned lands. One can trace the roots of much of the land degradation and extraction of natural resources that are fueling climate change back to land privatization and speculation. To hold land as a commons in a perpetual stewardship entity such as a Regenerative Community Land Trust ensures that the land will be preserved and stewarded regeneratively for generations to come. 

The Commons Credit will grow to be a key layer in the ReFi economic engine that pays communities for their regenerative stewardship practices, activating the grass-roots, community-led fight against climate change.

Over 80% of the world's biodiversity is held within lands stewarded by indigenous groups and organizations, with most of them practicing some sort of communal land ownership. That means that the majority of the world's biodiversity - including genetic diversity, plant, animal, fungal diversity, etc. - relies on the success of the commons and its regenerative management. Developing a Commons Credit protocol to financially empower the stewards of communally held lands can play a critical role in the preservation and protection of this biodiversity.


Future assurance for the carbon and eco-credits

The Commons Credit acts as an ‘assurance layer’ to projects that are producing carbon credits, eco-credits, and other impact certificates. The ‘assurance’ is that the projects receiving climate impact funding cannot simply be abandoned and sold for private gain after a few years, because they take place on community-owned lands, held in trust. In turn, this strengthens the claim of any climate project that the impact they are making is, indeed, long-term and for the benefit of the community. 

The Commons Credit has the unique function of an impact assurance layer, ensuring that land-based impact funded by carbon credits (and other eco-credits) is preserved in perpetuity.

CrypColosseum is a platform where DAO members can submit, support or challenge proposals.DAO members must sign a Community Covenant that states the rules, mission and vision of the DAO. Signing it indicates that a member agrees with the values of the DAO and unlocks access to the governance features.

CrypColosseum uses ‘Conviction Voting’, a novel governance method that is based on the length of time that voters indicate their preference for a particular action, rather than requiring a yes/no vote.

Proposals can be challenged and escalated to a dispute management system called ‘Celeste’, made up of a decentralized, randomly selected group of independent arbiters.DAO governance tokens can be generated using CrypColosseum or imported.

The mechanism that powers Celeste is that Keepers, the independent arbiters of proposal disputes, make money when their decision is the same as the majority of other Keepers but lose money when their decision is different. Each Keeper is anonymous and is unaware of other Keepers’ decisions. In theory, this should lead to them reaching a verdict they believe to be in agreement with the established values and norms outlined in the Community Covenant.

Leevtis is a platform that enables users to mint their Web3 achievements as Soulbound NFTs and where communities can contextualize on-chain actions. Leevtis’s mission is to build a protocol that allows anyone to program arbitrary rules into a badge that can be claimed. Making these badges more accessible to other users, decentralized applications and protocols will help drive interesting behaviors and endless use-cases.



Web3 empowers anyone from the world, for the first time in history, to interact with any decentralized application on a “shared state device”--where all records of these interactions are immutably stored on a public database. At Leevtis, we believe that both understanding these on-chain interactions and digital footprints and making them useful through badges will be one of the most important primitives upon which the Web3 stack is built over the next decade.



Through Leevtis, users are able to discover on-chain achievements curated by the community and mint them as non-transferable NFTs called ‘Badges’. It is implemented as a set of smart contracts and a validating oracle to provide composable badges and built-in on-chain data validation. Publisher of a badge can deploy specific badge standards—which includes detailed metadata of the on-chain achievement and eligibility criteria—to the blockchain. When a user attempts to claim a badge, Leevtis’s validating oracle—which fetches and synchronizes Ethereum blockchain data—provides proof for the Leevtis Protocol by analyzing the user’s historic transaction data and validating whether or not the user is eligible.

Leevtis aims to contribute to build up a more collaborative and meritocratic network where one’s contribution, participation and reputation is valued.

We create open source tools and libraries that enables the DAOhaus framework to be used as a public good, in line with our mission to foster a diverse, open economy of transparent cooperation.

DAOhaus’ Social Impact

DAOhaus is committed to a community first culture that furthers the development of the web3 DAO ecosystem. Our culture has attracted thousands of DAOs to launch on our platform like:
MetaCartel Ventures: An investment DAO with over $6.6M TVL
Moloch Rises: A grants giving DAO with over $2.5M TVL
Game Mine Alliance: A P2E game community with over $2M TVL
DiamondBank: A data science DAO with $370K TVL
RaidGuild: A service DAO with over $200K TVL
We have built a considerable following (15.7k followers on Twitter and 6,300 members in Discord) that allows us to act as stewards for the community by advocating, discussing, and sharing knowledge that improves the DAO ecosystem.
One of our programs, HausParty is a weekly tradition that started in our server and recently grew to Twitter Spaces. Our lively discussions tackle issues we face in our communities and provide a space for people to openly talk about them. Some of our shows include:
HausParty Live featuring Raid Guild Season 1 Cohort
HausParty Live featuring Pet3rPan
HausParty Live featuring the DAOhaus community
Our community members also publish content relevant to the community on Mirror and Substack. Their articles have covered the basics of Moloch DAOs, DAO governance patterns, and more.
Our platform has over 3,000 DAOs summoned, almost 45,000 proposals created, and approximately $100,000,000 in funds passed through treasuries. (source: stats.daohaus.club) DAOhaus has also been featured in noteable publications like Decrypt, Forbes, and HackerNoon.

DAO Experimentation

Experimentation is built into the core of DAOhaus. We believe the only way to push the ecosystem forward is by trying new and innovative approaches.
We launched DAOgroni to experiment with a new “fair launch” NFT project that combines the power of an ERC721 token and a Moloch DAO. DAOgroni allows anyone to mint an NFT that may be burned for shares in the DAO with the mint proceeds going directly to the DAO treasury.
We also developed Yeet, a web3 crowdfunding tool with built in DAO governance. When a person contributes to Yeet, they gain shares in the initiative that protects their interest via the “ragequit” mechanism.
During the recent market downturn, we experimented with a new form of governance. DAOhaus transitioned from a retroactive compensation model to a RFP system to extend runway and focus contributors on specific objectives for the DAO.

What Grant Funds Will Be Used For

We are on the verge of deploying DAOhaus v3 which introduces a new, composable platform that unlocks the next level of coordination for DAOs.
The grant funding will be used to support our team of contributors including the development team that is working on delivering DAOhaus v3. This also includes covering security audits.
Security is a top priority for DAOhaus v3 smart contracts and frontend. As an open-source product built as a public good, we are committed to taking the appropriate steps to properly audit our contracts. This will ensure our contracts are battle tested and ready to be unleashed into the wild.

7292,Scopefy Protocol,0,0x334EF963B3f4AB3c9E4f2580e734025FAc830fFB,"Overview

The Scopefy Protocol is a Web3 social graph that aims to empower creators to own the links between themselves and their community, forming a fully composable and decentralized social graph. This is achieved by allowing users to create profiles and interact with each other via these profiles. “Profile” (as used here) refers specifically to Scopefy profiles; “user” refers to standard crypto wallets.

The Protocol is currently overseen by a multisig, which will be expanded to a broader DAO that can develop and vote on new modules and expanded functionality.

Let's first dig into profile creation and publishing. Users must create a profile on the hub, for which they will receive a sequentially ID'd profile NFT. This NFT controls the profile, and thus, its owner becomes the de facto controller of the given profile.

Profile owners can:

1.Publish to the profile. Publication types are:

Post: A standard piece of content.
Comment: A standard piece of content with a pointer to another publication. Since comments include a pointer, this executes the pointed publication's ""reference module"" logic, if any.
Mirror: The equivalent of a ""share"" in a traditional sense, having no content but a pointer to another publication. Since mirrors only include a pointer, this executes the pointed publication's ""reference module"" logic, if any.

2.Set the profile's ""follow module"":

This whitelisted logic contract determines the logic that must be executed when a wallet attempts to follow the given profile; for example, some followers may incur a fee to the profile owner via the fee follow module contract.

3.Set the profile's image URI

4.Set the profile's ""dispatcher"":

This is an address that can act on behalf of a profile's owner; it can publish to the given profile and set the given profile's URI.

In summary, the Scopefy Protocol is a composable social graph protocol built to be community-owned and ever-evolving. It empowers its users by allowing them to decide how they want their social graph to be built and how they want it to be monetized, if at all.

and more to feel excited about as we move forward…

Join us in bringing independent stability at scale to the Ethereum ecosystem.


We are putting our efforts into providing users with assurance of system security, through accepting censorship resistant collateral only, integrating with reliable partners and coordinating in a progressively more decentralized way. 

We are looking closely into a fee module where the system collects stabilizing and beneficent fees embedded at the protocol level. The value accumulated from fees will be distributed to support the development and robustness of the protocol and incentivize participants of the governance, LPs and system security providers. 

We do not take the topic of underfunded open-source software lightly, and therefore we aim to pledge a % of fees accumulated towards public goods funding.

Differentiation
	1. First crypto to beat any existing fiat currency (or fiat pegged stablecoin) in price-stability.
	2. No equivalent stability present in the existing monetary market, thus becoming the first crypto-native solution to out-perform traditional monetary solutions.
	3. Offering price-stability, different from $USD-pegged coins, that currently create 99.97% of all stablecoin volume locked on the chain.
	4. Built on resilient, battle tested and open-source protocol following in the footsteps of giants, paving the way for the next generation DeFi.

Why?
We believe that protection of purchasing power, sovereignty and equity of users will lead to more open and prosperous future for us all. We can alleviate the burden of today’s monetary currencies by shifting away from a single point of value determination (e.g. $USD) to diversify the risk of dependency and to ensure crypto market integrity.

What?
The protocol (fork of Maker) acts as overcollateralised debt position, enabling users to mint ¤GSUc - the first GSU soft-pegged stablecoin that optimally reduces volatility and the risk of disorderly exchange-rate movement through a proven price stability system.

How?
Minting ¤GSUc will be made available to users by interacting with underlying vaults, where the provisions will be possible in ETH, wBTC, $DAI and other prominent, qualified crypto assets that have to pass through risk assessment, have their collateral ratios adjusted and approved.

7298,PsyDAO - Democratizing & Decentralizing Psychedelic Research,0,0xf62D09bA0C02dD7d3E6fa8dF03f89DF50DC13440,"
What is PsyDAO?

TLDR;
 
PsyDAO aims to fund and democratize early-stage psychedelic research and IP through the use of tokenized ownership, community governance and an emphasis on open source.


We are in the midst of a psychedelic renaissance. Psilocybin, LSD, MDMA and ketamine – compounds once regarded as recreational drugs – are being re-examined as legitimate medicines to treat mental health conditions. The rush of companies entering the psychedelic industry has led to an influx of patent applications, marking the beginning of the journey to commercialization. 

At PsyDAO we believe that these life-changing compounds should be developed and commercialized in a way that is values-aligned with the patients, users, researchers, investors and communities that come together to develop them. This is why we are forming a decentralized, autonomous, member-owned organization (DAO) dedicated to the sustainable and ethical advancement of psychedelic medicines.

PsyDAO intends to be a hivemind — a literal collective consciousness for the ethical development of psychedelics 

PsyDAO aims to fund and democratize early-stage psychedelic research and IP through tokenized ownership, community governance and open source technology. Where applicable, PsyDAO will hold IP rights in underlying research projects that it supports, which will be attached to ‘IP NFTs’. For compounds where IP claims are possible, PsyDAO will develop a portfolio that is actively managed by the community in an aligned way to democratize development and access. For naturally-occurring compounds such as psilocybin, PsyDAO aims to create powerful, open-source data repositories that will be governed by the community.

The IP tokenization system is a mixture of meme magic and mathemagic. Built with our friends at Molecule and VitaDAO, it enables PsyDAO to create open research and participation markets for known psychedelics, selectively distributing rights and benefits to partners and contributors. 

Current status of PsyDAO:

We are in the early stages of building a DAO. We have assembled an amazing group of core contributors and stewards, identified several exciting psychedelic research projects and cultivated a community of supporters over 1000 strong. 

Research Projects we are supporting:

Part of PsyDAO’s mission is to support open source projects that advance Psychedelic medicine and Science. Two projects we are currently supporting are:

The Open Ketamine Project, in collaboration with Crowd Funded Cures - working to make an off-patent version of Ketamine available to patients at lower cost than patented versions

The Entheogen Genome Project, in collaboration with The Entheome Foundation - working to sequence all known psychedelic fungi and plants, and to provide the data freely to all

Over the next quarter we plan to: 

+ Create a contributor model to enable community members to create, contribute and have a voice in DAO governance 
+ Further build out the team to include industry, ethical and scientific advisors
+ Solidify our business model and tokenomics model
+ Establish operations and governance guardrails for the DAO
+ Source cutting edge, original research projects that will advance the psychedelic space

How will these funds be used:

Funding raised in the GR15 round will be used to pay for ongoing operating expenses and to  pay key contributors to build out the infrastructure described above.

Here is a detailed twitter thread by @darinmandarin. and here is a tweet from @Gitcoin


MRV 1O1 is a project that spun out of a founder’s circle in the ReFi DAO. When it comes to safeguarding our food supply from effects of climate change, effective measurement, reporting and verification (MRV) of soil regeneration, Crops’ health improvement and biodiversity enhancement is critical to help small scale farmers and growers navigate tough challenges of climate change.

To help small scale projects get full benefits of carbon, ecocredits and other incentives for ecosystem services, MRV Research Group is working to publish MRV1O1, a guide to quickly understand and implement relevant MRV best practices.



The Problem

Traditional MRV approaches are prohibitively expensive, often constituting 30-40% of the costs for large projects over 1200 hectares. What’s worse, these expenses are always upfront before generating revenue from the project. Additionally, the MRV methodologies are difficult to understand and often do not include regenerative practices valued by local communities. Data gathered during traditional MRV practices is usually kept in silos and has no useful application or benefits for smaller farmers.
Small farmers produce most of the world’s food supply and they don’t have any solutions to turn to Regenerative Practices. This scenario offers us a significant opportunity for regenerative impact. Additionally, Small farmers need support in switching to regenerative practices to protect their farms and livelihood from the effects of climate change.

Our Solution

To publish a guide with the tools needed for small projects to conduct MRV and reap the rewards. In the guide’s first edition, we are starting with agriculture, agroforestry, and small-scale farming examples. We plan to cover other types of projects in future versions.

Deliverables (Each Phase lasting ~ 4-6 months)

Phase 1: Understanding traditional MRV approaches, with in-depth Research.

Phase 2: Filtering out relevant MRV practices for Small Scale Projects.

Phase 3: Combining Our learnings with on-ground best practices and publish the guide.

Phase 4: Automation of data collection, reporting and verification for development of dMRV.

Phase 5: TBD by the working group participants.


What the Funds Will Be Used For

Research existing MRV practices such as Verra, Gold Standard, Regen Network and Climate Action Reserve to learn from and adapt existing methodologies to be viable at smaller scale.
Select relevant additional MRV areas from Bloom Network’s regenerative actions list, in order to include on-the-ground and community-led perspectives on what are valuable impact/results.
Conduct interviews to understand what questions a project developer needs answered.
Interview existing sensor tech projects and other results monitoring platforms, to identify which methods are feasible for small-scale projects to implement.
Publish the MRV 101 guide for small-scale projects. It will help project leaders identify which MRV methodologies make sense for their project, and get up and running with measurement and ReFi protocols as quickly as possible.
Begin pilot projects with Ogallala Life and Shamba projects.
Iterate with more impact areas and community feedback
Through the process we are building collaboration and interoperability across ReFi projects supporting this scale.

7259,The Community Health project,0,0x4A62ec005ad047FfE3Ab7828f050aD531DC86891,"TLDR
Both DAOs and Web3 projects depend on the health of their community and vibez—yet understanding and measuring Community Health is challenging because it relies on the quality and depth of relationship between community members. Without good community indicators, we're often shooting in the dark and less humane metrics get the bulk of the attention, resulting in a more transactional and less community-driven Web3 ecosystem.
This is an ongoing project to research Community Health metrics and practices, and develop a data collection tool to enable web3 communities to benchmark, track progress, take action effectively, and thrive.

The Problem
Today, DAOs and Web3 projects are left to rely on the limited reporting provided by Discord or Discourse and a patchwork of ""homemade"" surveys to fill in the gaps. These solutions are limited, time-consuming for community managers and contributors to use, and the results, hampered by poor indicators and/or poor sampling, are unreliable.
Perhaps even direr, the lack of real-time analytics leaves community leaders without established baselines to measure against to understand the impact of community-focused initiatives, monitor shocks to the system, or rapidly gauge the effects of system-wide changes. As a result, many projects measure growth in numbers but not belonging, engagement, trust, and reciprocity. We're at risk of losing the heart and soul of our communities in favour of mechanistic growth.
To champion real community at the heart of Web3, we've started the Community Health project.

The Solution
The project has three parts:
Ongoing research to conceptualise and identify reliable, scientifically-valid, practical and regeneration-inspired community metrics (tight coupling of the Community Health Framework and its associated metrics, and updating the Framework when necessary).
Identify practices that advance Community Health (including facilitating regular workshops with community leaders and sharing findings) so that problems encountered can be addressed effectively.
Development of an open-source data collection tool that allows operationalising the Community Health Framework by gathering data on community platforms (discord, Twitter, telegram, etc.), processing the data, and providing insights and benchmarking.

Let's make Web3 community-driven, resilient and humane.

7301,ENS Spoofing Bot: Detect a Scam Name That Looks Like Yours,0,0x7b736FE138775D1fCD2CFE4E1D6158BfF3a2F28e,"The purpose of ENS Spoofing Bot is to notify users that their name may have been spoofed and publish it to Forta Explorer, which allows new types of scam attacks to be detected and the damage from them minimized.



The problem

Names in the Ethereum Name Service are unique, but there are no restrictions on registering look-alike names that are visually very difficult to distinguish from genuine ones. For example, having a name vitalik.eth, an attacker can register a similar name by replacing the symbol lowercase L with uppercase i: vitaIik.eth. The name is visually similar, but it is treated by the protocol as a completely different name, with its own hash, as well as an address bound to it. 

This type of attack is called a homograph attack. Regarding the ENS protocol, it can be performed in the following ways:

Substitution of character pairs i/I, i/j, O/0, w/vv, m/rn, which depending on the typeface, may be difficult or impossible to distinguish;
Replacing ascii characters with visually similar ones from Unicode; for example, “faсebooсk.eth” uses the letters o and с from Cyrillic;
Use of invisible Unicode characters; 
Spoofing using uppercase letters; for example, bitcoin.eth may be spoofed as Bitcoin.eth. 

ENS fights this attack pretty hard by normalizing names before they are registered, as well as warning against using non-ascii characters on its site. However, to save gas, such checks have been implemented off-chain, on the frontend side. Any user can register a name bypassing the official site by calling the protocol contract directly.

The Proposal

It is proposed to develop a Forta bot that monitors on-chain contract events responsible for registering "".eth"" names. As soon as the bot detects a new registered name, it tries to normalize it and checks if a similar name has already been registered. If so, the bot fires an alert specifying the registered name, the existing normalized name, and the addresses of the accounts to which these names are bound.

Forta Protocol allows each user to subscribe to alerts involving their addresses, so if their name is spoofed, they will immediately receive a notification in one of the convenient ways: Email, Telegram, Discord, Slack or Webhook.

In addition, when combined with bots that detect subsequent stages of suspicious activity, we will have enough evidence to claim a scam attack. For example, the next follow-up checks could be obtaining tokens, selling them, and laundering funds through services like Tornado Cash. 

As a result, the Forta ENS Spoofing Bot will play an important role in detecting scam attacks, maximizing the chances of their detection.

Through my experience as a professional journalist and podcast producer I have started two podcasting companies: Volume and Alibi Investigations. I have won 16 awards, covered all manner of subjects and worked for a large number of high-profile companies. 

However, the Lootverse presents something very special. There is potential to tell a compelling audio story (over multiple episodes) about the creation of the project and the builders. We could dig into the history of Loot, the exciting projects that continue to proliferate, like The Eye (for Adventurers)  and The Loot MMO, its capacity to expand and the future for the community going forward. 

Production of the podcast would be rewarding for all involved. We would interview, write, record, edit and produce each episode of the podcast to the highest standard. 

Interviewing: $900
Editing: $600
Production: $300
Voice over: $600
Studio time: $500
Mixing and Mastering: $400
Composing original music: $200
Each episode would cost $3,500 to produce. 

This would include the cost of employing a documentary-style editor, composing original music and mixing and mastering each episode to a professional standard. 

4 documentary-style podcasting episodes would cost $14,000. I will reach out to key figures in the Loot community in order to interview them about their knowledge and experience.

Many passionate people and organizations are already designing and building tools and systems to improve each of these research processes.

We want to help create a structure that can integrate these movements into a cohesive system. The best way we see to accomplish this mission is by establishing new education systems.

In our first step towards this goal, we are hosting ""research sessions"" viewed by a ""collective intelligence"". In the research session, a researcher records their laptop/room/conversation (depending on the type of research), much like Steven Wolfram does: Steven Wolfram Live Streams. The sessions are viewed by a ""collective intelligence"": anyone in the world who is excited about learning and advancing science, essentially the ""students"". It is unique because they converse online, answer each other's questions, and only once a week communicate their unanswered questions to the researcher.

Primary advantages of our proposed approach are:
Free education that is accessible to anyone in the world.
Higher quality research, accomplished through peer review happening during ""research sessions"".
Reducing teaching time: professors who don't want to be teaching do not need to be thanks to our system that relies on the professor communicating with the student's ""collective intelligence"".
Integrating research into the real world by incentivizing a decentralized team to execute on required tasks.
Training of the next generation of researchers with hands on experience from world class experts.

Instead of a researcher, the “session leader” would be a leader from your DAO, and your audience would be people who want to get onboarded into your community. Giving your potentially new community members access to the brightest minds in your org, without distracting your bright minds from building.

We are excited about this model because ANYONE IN THE WORLD will have access to what world class experts on any given topic are CURRENTLY working on. Right now, only the researchers collaborators have access to this information. The public has to wait years until the research is published. Moreover, the researcher needs to exert the same amount of energy as they would with ONE graduate student, in order to get the collective intelligence of potentially thousands of individuals (Steven Wolfram has 1k-2.5k viewers for each of his live streams).

The money from this grant will allow us to pay contributors, purchase required tooling, and

KingDAOs is a platform that allows anyone to create a simple DAO. KingDAOs act as an extremely versatile commitment to facilitate the decentralization of networks to a worldwide community. Through the flexible and collaborative governance, KingDAOs are empowering like-minded individuals to come together and take action in a truly collective way.



There are still common problems during DAOs development:

1.Scalability. At present, many DAO tooling products generally have the common issues such as low scalability, limited interation and upgrade, which directly impacts the development of DAOs.

2.Compatibility. Compatibility is another great challenge for DAOs. There is no unified API or development documents that are effectively compatible and worsely most DAOs can not implement the function of collaborative governance.

3.Diversity. Like any product,diversity and demand are interrelated. Most products can only meet some needs for general functions, but cannot satify the diverse and different needs of the DAOs.



The KingDAOs protocol is a set of open protocols that can interact with internal modules and external protocols. Its vision is to create a module on its platform that enables anyone to set up a DAO based on their needs.

Xocolatl es un protocolo decentralizado, en fase prototipo, para acuñar tokens ERC20 con paridad 1:1 al peso mexicano (MXN) y puedan ser utilizados en la economía Web3.
Xocolatl ha surgido para ayudar a los mexicanos a transicionar a la web3.
Los contribuidores de Xocolatl queremos crear la moneda que de entrada a México para integrarse a la economía decentralizada popularmente conocida como ""DeFi"".

México y DeFi

A pesar de que las monedas estables como DAI, USDC y USDT han empoderado las finanzas decentralizadas (DeFi) desde el 2017, México y el peso Mexicano en específico no han dado un paso adelante.
XOC es el primer cimiento en el ecosistema del país que permitirá al mexicano/a accesar a nuevas herramientas financieras que estan revolucionando la economia global.
Uno de los muchos motivos por los que creemos que XOC es un moneda necesaria, es para facilitar el flujo de capital sin restricciones entre México y los Estados Unidos.

La PípilaDAO

Las Organizaciones Autonomas Decentralizadas (DAO en inglés) son cooperativas digitales que permiten a un conjunto de personas coolaborar en un proyecto sin importar quienes sean, de donde vienen, en que creen, o en donde residen.
En este caso, PipilaDAO es creada para ser la organizacion encargada para el desarrollo y control de la moneda decentralizada XOC.
Todos son bienvenidos a contribuir y se utiliza Coordinape para que por medio de un sistema de evaluacion social, la contribución de cada integrante en PípilaDAO sea de manera abierta, facil y transparente.

Xocolatl is a decentralized protocol, in prototype phase, to mint ERC20 tokens with 1:1 parity to the Mexican peso (MXN) and can be used in the Web3 economy.
Xocolatl has emerged to help Mexicans transition to web3.
The contributors of Xocolatl want to create the currency that will allow Mexico to join the decentralized economy popularly known as ""DeFi"".

Mexico and DeFi

Although stable currencies such as DAI, USDC and USDT have empowered decentralized finance (DeFi) since 2017, Mexico and the Mexican peso in specific have not stepped up.
XOC is the first foundation in the country's ecosystem that will allow Mexicans to access new financial tools that are revolutionizing the global economy.
One of the many reasons we believe XOC is a necessary currency is to facilitate the unrestricted flow of capital between Mexico and the United States.


The PipilaDAO

Decentralized Autonomous Organizations (DAO) are digital cooperatives that allow a set of people to collaborate on a project regardless of who they are, where they come from, what they believe in, or where they reside.
In this case, PipilaDAO is created to be the organization in charge of the development and control of the decentralized currency XOC.
Everyone is welcome to contribute and we use Coordinape, DAOHaus and other tools so that through a social evaluation system, the contribution of each member in PipilaDAO is open, easy and transparent.

85% of people are emotionally disengaged at work. That’s a clear sign that work needs an upgrade. We at Eden Protocol set out to build that upgrade in the form of a decentralised, community driven solution that helps people find the right project to contribute to - and vice versa, starting in DAOs - eventually spread across web3. We are working with enthusiastic devs from DeveloperDAO, crypto natives from BanklessDAO. We are fully community driven, which is why we’re here, talking to you, hoping to rely on the crypto community via donations and grants to help us in our journey to unlock the passion economy for everyone in the world. 

About:

Eden will be the world's opportunity protocol, providing a place where everyone can find work they love and grow, thanks to our two-way person-project matching system. This system is Eden's core, built from an ML-driven assistant, a platform-like interface, and some epic mechanics. 

Communities can integrate Eden into Discord, Slack, Telegram, or wherever they are. Think of it like an assistant that always learns and works as an automated, personal project scout; it flags the most relevant individuals for projects and vice versa. With this, Eden will open opportunities on all ends of the web3 ecosystem by streamlining overwhelming discord servers, convoluted onboarding processes and outdated notion tables. The result is brilliant talent coordination & resource allocation, minus the headache.

Mission Statement

Our purpose is to make work, work for all.
Our vision is to build an opportunity protocol built on the principles of purpose & community.
Our mission is to unlock community powered economic opportunities.
Our values: 
Growth: No-one is born with all their skills, thoughts, connections, ideas,... fully developed. Growth is the ultimate super power that we aim to foster in everyone & in ourselves.  
Community: Everything starts with people coming together. We play longterm games with longterm people. There is no stronger foundation than strong, caring & genuine connections.   
Purpose: There is nothing more powerful than the human soul on fire. If community brings people together, purpose gives them direction. We are & foster cathedral-builders. 
Opportunity: Luck is an attitude. By creating the right environments you can make luck a lot more likely. We create environments where better opportunities can happen at higher frequency.  
Foresight: The best way to predict the future is to create it. We actively think from first principles to find better ways. We are foresight pioneers.  
Impact: We care about what you can do more than what you did. We hack value, before we hack growth. We’re intentional about the change we intend to make. 

Key principles

Imagine purpose & community being the key reasons people come together to learn, earn, connect & collaborate. What would an opportunity protocol that enables such a purpose & community-driven economy, look like? A simple idea with massive potential impact.

7279,Sigmate- User based NFT information platform,0,0x0Ed366EF14c57bE98a69bd2745094C67A3E49362,"##Introduction
 
The importance of NFT(Non-Fungible Tokens) is growing rapidly not only in blockchain ecosystem but also in real-life industry. Their traits such as rarity, uniqueness, validity are used in field such as gaming, entertainment, sports, etc. However, the swiftly growing industry has some barriers to newcomers. First, the information is scattered all around the internet that it’s hard to keep track of them. Second, it’s hard to find reliable information because of the broad amount of information in the market. Lastly, evaluation of NFTs is difficult due to lack of quantified metrics in the field.
 
##Problem
 
Currently, NFT investors rely on individual subjective data created by ""influencers"" who independently provide information in messenger-based communities such as Discord, Blog, Twitter, and Telegram. In this situation, investors use various media to obtain information about NFT, and investors’ anxiety about the market is prevalent as they rely on unclear messenger-based media for specific information or un evaluation of NFT. In addition, there are cases in which investors are deceived by the information providers because there is no verification process. For example, many report cases of failure after investing in projects that are falsely promising, which are promoted and advertised by the influencers.\n\nAs the NFT market is a new market, fraud using information asymmetry is actively taking place. For example, copying fraud, in which existing intellectual property rights (IPs) that are not registered as NFTs are newly registered as a NFT by a third party, or when content that is already registered as NFT is copied and published, is creating confusion and damage for novice investors. Furthermore, there are frequent cases of deceiving investors, such as stealing and exploiting card and blockchain wallet information by impersonating NFT exchanges or employees, and rugs that disappear after receiving investment for NFT projects. 

For investors, to avoid being subjected to impersonation fraud and rugpool, a system must be established to carefully examine and verify the history of the project group. However, it is difficult for retail investors to obtain fraud-related information, and many NFT investors are exposed to this risk due to the problems of the messenger-based community as mentioned above. This has led to greater distrust of the NFT market and acts as a hindrance to the growth of the NFT market.

These problems can all be solved in Sigmate. The revolution of NFT ecosystem aggregates the data to maximize your experience.
The following are our current and future services:
Scattered information is gathered and written in Wiki format.
Know everything about NFT: such as past rug-pulls, wallet address of current owner, floor price, mint price, etc.
Keep project announcements updated without using Discord and Twitter.
Ensure reliability through cross-validation between users and Sigmate.
Keep notified with upcoming NFTs projects with your own calendar.
Write your own wiki page and earn token using write-2-earn system.
Talk about your NFTs and share your opinions that are sorted by different categories.
Evaluate your NFTs with our index and metrics.
Win NFTs and whitelists with our Draw.

 
##Solution
 
NFT has a number of collections that produce a variety of series on one subject. Traditional Wikipedia takes the form of a simple introduction to the NFT exchange rather than an introduction to these collections. We are planning to provide detailed and detailed information on all NFTs in the collection as individual pages. In addition, we will increase user convenience by providing UI/UX specialized in providing NFT information.Users can create and edit wiki in Sigmate platform. Editing articles will reward users based on the word count and the effort. Once users are given the credibility with reliable edits, higher rewards will be compensated. After TGE, Sigma Tokens will be distributed according to the contributions of users.
 


 

##Features

To help NFT investors make properinvestment decisions, Sigmate provides features that protect users from the risk of copying fraud. By linking APIs provided by Etherscan to provide real-time tracking of whose wallet a specific NFT is on the blockchain, users can check whether NFT is true or not easily. This solves the problems that first-time NFT investors face in the process of collecting distributed information and ensuring trust for users, as well as barriers to entry, which can increase new NFT investors and help the NFT market to grow.
 

The Community
Become the part your NFT community in Sigmate. Lack of space to freely share your opinion of projects hinder the growth of NFT community. Share your thoughts more freely and less formally in Sigmate.

We plan to update announcements in various project communities in real time to collect distributed information and provide convenient functions so that information about projects can be easily checked without accessing each community one by one. NFT project provides their community with whitelists and OGs before the mint. Investors must go through certain tasks that the NFT projects require through Discord Channels. For investors without much experience and knowledge in NFTs, it is difficult to get a whitelist position. To help and shorten investors’ time and effort, we will collect and provide projects’ how-to-whitelist guides in Sigmate. 



Stats

The valuation of NFTs has always been a question of investors. Due to lack of liquidity, speculation, and diversity, the evaluation has been hindered.
It’s important to know the correct value of your data in Web 3.0. Sigmate’s algorithm allows you to compare you NFTs with our indices. Correlation between them can help you to evaluation your NFTs.

7260,The RealmsFolk of the Lootverse,0,0x5C93029FFcB89D0E4291044DA6f292DbBd3FFCD8,"TL:DR A hand-made Loot PFP collection. Bind the Lootverse together with 500 unique inhabitants of the Realms drawn by veteran artists.


Summary:
The Lootverse has seen its Realms filled with Heroes and Adventurers but what about the commonfolk? The farmers, bakers, hunters, furriers, fishers, merchants, exotics, and everyday residents.

The Loot ecosystem is already brimming with creative energy and talent. We will launch a project that will harness and reward that creativity.

With this grant, we will commission artists to populate the Lootverse with Realmsfolk. Each Folk will hail from a specific Realm, feature a unique face, and have a style of dress relative to their life and/or occupation. Artists and contributors are invited to “Lootify” themselves and transpose their likeness into the Realms.

We will create a style guide and fee structure so that we can pay artists to draw each and every inhabitant of the Realms. The style guide will give the collection a unified look and feel; any artist who contributes a character will be paid for their work and materials.

The size of the collection will be proportional to the grant funding, with a minimum of 500 RealmsFolk and a maximum of 8000 - one for every Realm!

The goal is to begin occupying the homes and hovels apart from the adventures. With 500 unique figures, we will be making a small dent in filling the Realms with inhabitants. 

There is a chance to release a large-scale collection where features are mixed and matched from the original collection. 


Allocation of Funds:
Once the style guide is established (developed by TicklishArt and Thomas Radio), artists will be invited to contribute their Realmsfolk to the collection. We will pay an $18 flat rate for each contribution that fits the style and format requirements.

500 commissions x $18 = $9000

Each contributing artist will also receive a share of the royalties from the sale of the NFT collection. Each Realms inhabitant they contribute will earn them a greater share.

What artists do with their funding is up to them, whether it is to buy supplies or hire models as character studies. 

There are 500 potential pieces to be made and the goal of open submissions for anyone who would like to get involved.

A portion of the Grant will be reserved for launching the smart contract. Artists will appreciate a royalty split equal to their contribution to the collection. Estimated at 1.5k USD

Goal:
9,000 USD

Stretch Goal: 
18,000 USD (just 2 dollars per Realm!)

If the funding for this round (GR15) falls short, the project will remain in development (artists are still gonna art) until fully funded.",Valid Ethereum Address.

7263,Moonjelly Impact NFTs - High Quality Data to Save Whales,0,0xFff208c3B48545f52F0937fbfEB5d11728baAD6e,"MOONJELLY INTRODUCTION
Moonjelly is a global community empowering local heroes and scaling ocean impact world-wide. Our mission is to accelerate science, reward impact, and rewild the ocean. Moonjelly is a proactive public goods funding protocol and thus our prototype below to demonstrate proof of concept will reflect this. In order to proceed, we will prototype, test, and test again to launch a new style of Ocean Impact NFTs with real value and utility.

Our first Impact NFT project is on whales. 


PILOT PROTOTYPE - USING DATA TO PROTECT WHALES AND FIGHT CLIMATE CHANGE



Why whales?

Whales are a public good. By choosing whales, we line up with a clear narrative that we’re here to build a protocol that promotes the funding and expansion of strong public goods projects. Whales play a key role in sustaining healthy ocean ecosystems and are a vital part in helping to combat climate change naturally in the ocean.

Every other breath we take comes from the ocean thanks to phytoplankton, tiny organisms that generate half the photosynthesis on the planet. They capture 40% of all man-made CO2 produced which is the same amount of carbon capture as 1.70 trillion trees. Phytoplankton is key. 

Along with many other ecosystem services, whales may help maintain phytoplankton biomass. They have a multiplier effect on phytoplankton and fisheries as whale poop is loaded with iron and nitrogen which feeds and grows phytoplankton as whales cross the oceans, fertilising along the way and in the process creating “The Whale Conveyor Belt.” More whales = more poop = more phytoplankton = more natural carbon sequestration and stronger fisheries - at minimal cost.

All we really need to do is leave them alone and allow them to do their job. With a 60-year life span for humpbacks and up to 200 years for right and bowhead whales, protecting and valuing whales for their incredible ecosystem services could be one of the smartest, most affordable, and most impactful actions toward fighting climate change and rebuilding ocean ecosystems. 


PHASE 1 - ORIGINAL IMPACT
In PHASE 1 (Q3/2022), we work with “Original Impact” which is part of our “Original Collectables - Science that Changed/Kick-started Ocean Conservation"" series of NFTs. There always has to be a first - and Original NFTs will honor and reward those achievements.

We curate drops in this series with rich storytelling from the impact origin story, driving home why this science and research is important to the world. Science that was not only transformational for conservation but also sparked more research and careers for other scientists in the field. For the buyer, these impact collectibles have the potential to generate exponential value, similar to American rookie baseball cards, as natural capital becomes verifiable, tradable assets in the future. 


PHASE 2 - FUTURE IMPACT  


Can funding data collection from satellite tags for migrating whales add to data sets that would help protect whales in certain high risk areas from ship strikes? If we could protect X percentage of the whales off the west coast of South America as they migrate back and forth each year between Antarctica and Columbia, we could reduce ship collisions by Y whales per year.

In PHASE 2 (Q4/2022), through our first in a series of FUTURE IMPACT NFT drops, we will be selling Impact NFTs to fund the collection and sharing of high quality data from 50 satellite tags that will show science, shipping companies and policymakers the most important humpback whale areas and highways, from Antarctica to Columbia.

In the absence of data, we don’t want to manage the whole ocean. Conservation data needs to be specific for policymakers. Humpback whales only need 4-6 weeks of extra protection during the most crucial times when they migrate through high traffic port zones, but more high quality, accessible data is needed to prove when and where specifically. Moonjelly Impact NFTs will help create this open source data that currently does not exist.  


MEET ARI FRIEDLAENDER



Ari is a renowned whale specialist, National Geographic Explorer, and tenured professor at UC Santa Cruz. Ari has long-term ecological research projects ongoing in Alaska, California, Massachusetts, North Carolina, and Antarctica (with over 40 trips to Antarctica). He has helped in the development of tag technology and visualisation tools to better understand the underwater movements and behaviors of marine mammals.

Moonjelly has partnered with Ari to sell his first ever Original Impact NFTs and Future Impact NFTs. The first four Original Impact NFTs will wrap the data collected with the impact created and be sold as:

1. First ever underwater behavior tag deployed on a whale in Antarctica

2. First ever video tag deployed on a whale in Antarctica

3. First ever long term satellite tracking tag deployed on a whale in Antarctica

4. First ever acoustic receiver deployed underwater in Antarctica


HOW THIS GR15 GRANT WILL BE USED
In order to save more humpback whales as they migrate up and down the coast of South America every year, we need more high quality, open sourced data (for policymakers and shipping companies). In order to collect and share more data, we need more satellite tags deployed on whales in both Antarctica and Columbia to track the whales as they migrate. In order to fund these satellite tags, Moonjelly will be selling Original and Future Impact NFTs specific to this mission.  

This grant will be used to help us build and test our first Impact NFTs for this project, and specifically to test design and functionality for:

A. The parameters for impact wrapping, and metadata definitions, done in close collaboration with our internal advisors and Moonjelly Academy’s Scientific Advisory Committee (SAC). The SAC is working to build open source frameworks for measuring and valuing impact created in the ocean and co-designing social and ethical guidelines for anti-colonial practices in ocean science; 

B. The onboarding process, data sharing, and NFT collaboration for a field scientist, here represented by Ari; 

C. Art curation and selection principles, artist onboarding, collaboration and artwork production with chosen artist (TBD) We will work with Moonjelly Academy to explore the ramifications of using art with impact NFTs and guidelines for best practices; 

D. Successfully getting an impact wrapped iNFT on chain, and running the transactions for two participant profiles; scientist and iNFT buyer. We will make a minimal functional marketplace capable of minting an iNFT and geared specifically towards ocean impact projects; 

E. Finally, we will use this proof of concept to produce and test clear communications of the impacts and benefits this project achieves for the ocean; to explain how our platform works through video prototypes and explainers; to share widely on our social media platforms; to create targeted community campaigns and materials for ocean scientists as well as ocean cultures. 


DeCon (DECENTRALIZED CONSERVATION)
One of Moonjelly's core missions is to decolonize science and empower people locally everywhere. In PHASE 2, we are collaborating with a Columbian Fulbright scholar (and her team) to do the humpback whale tagging work in Columbia. Ari and his team should not be flying in 2-3 times a year, for short time periods, to Columbia in order to deploy and collect the needed tagging data. Instead, we need local, capable heroes on the ground in these developing nations who are funded (not currently) and doing the needed work full time while also partnering with Ari’s lab on the work. We will have specific Impact NFTs in this collection to fund the Columbian whale tagging team to do this work.


OCEAN OF OPPORTUNITY
Once we prove our concept with the whale project, we have many other powerful ocean projects to follow in our pipeline - such as: monitoring ocean noise to reduce impacts on wildlife, using sound for developing coral reef early warning systems, mapping seafloor biodiversity to avoid impacts associated with offshore development, mapping coastal ecosystems to inform local management decisions, and much more.

7265,SimpUnion is a fixed rate lending platform with flexible terms on Ethereum.,0,0x8F489287142E91bc6D1a7D44bF8A29cdC3825797,"Overview

SimpUnion is a fixed rate lending platform with flexible terms on Ethereum that enables users to lend or borrow crypto assets at a fixed interest rate at any time. Unlike those protocols that only offer lenders at fixed rates, SimpUnion serves both sides of the borrowing and lending market by providing fixed rates.

In reality, SimpUnion introduces a concept of unified token called sCash to make all fixed-rate trades possible. sCash allows SimpUnion to tokenize payments in different currencies like ETH or USDC at specific points in the future. sCash is what SimpUnion uses to keep track of lenders, borrowers, debt details, lock-up period/maturities, maturity dates and so on.

SimpUnion has two primary features as below:

1.Longer-dated maturities.

On SimpUnion, of course users can choose to borrow or lend in a short term, at a fixed rate. At the same time, there are a lot of people who seek for a long term borrowing/lending need. The market is huge and SimpUnion fulfills those who need this. Users will be able to fix their interest rates for up to one year initially. And after that, users are allowed to expand maturity with fixed interest rates for up to two years, five years or even ten years.

2.Flexible dates.

SimpUnion allows users to lend or borrow to dates that don’t match the maturity of an active liquidity pool. SimpUnion’s innovative collateralization system ensures that users can have more choice regarding the maturity date of their loans without fracturing liquidity across a large number of liquidity pools.

SimpUnion is a sophisticated system, but it delivers a very simple message : SimpUnion empowers anyone in the world to access the secure and efficient fixed-rate loans by removing traditional financial intermediaries within the Ethereum ecosystem.

人人都在讲Community非常重要。什么是好的社区？

“协作” “社交”

人们将在DAO里认识彼此、建立更自由的协作关系。

join3正是聚焦于此。


If we talk about Web3, we could not avoid the topic of community. What is a good community and what people do within? Join3 has its answer, that is, a good community is capable of helping contributors collaborate and socialize.

Join3, an open source Web3 product, is focused on building closer community and helping more organizations transform into DAOs. If you are still waiting, We are sending an invitation letter and giving a hand to you.

About join3

Invitation to web3

The era of working behind closed doors is gone, and the importance of division of work has been aware of centuries ago. In this decentralized world, collaboration is the foundation that makes it work. How to use Web3 technology to record individual contributions and team collaboration, and how to build people's on-chain reputation and social relationships, are topics that cannot be ignored.

Join3 is building a collaboration-centered system that records the contributions and achievements of members who have reached consensus within the community, and draws a visual map of relationships linked by multiple nodes. In this way, DAO comes into being.

Is it really that hard to join Web3? We believe that any Web2 or even Web0 organization or member is welcome to become a member of DeSoc. In the name of Join3, we are sending an invitation to you!

Collaboration Records

Based on four different types of SBTs, Join3 is able to help organizations record members’ collaborative experiences, identity, achievements and other activities within the community.

PROJECTs: Proof of Collaboration
ROLEs: Proof of Role
SKILLs: Proof of Skill
EVENTs: Proof of Participation

Collaboration and Social

Web3 is a revolution of Relations of Production, and the core of which is decentralized collaboration. We believe that social relation in Web3 is more about decentralized collaboration and value creation, instead of just for entertainment.

Join3 has been dedicating to exploring the possibility of collaboration in social interaction, linking the connections among people, organizations, and projects, and eventually forming a collaborative network.

In this circumstances, socialization is not a recommendation letter from supervisor or bragging from peers. Combining with a decentralized contribution evaluation tool, Join3 could present genuine recognition among collaborators. Though cooperation, people can make friends, build trust, inspire one other and finally find the ideal collaborators.

People are the sum total of social relations. Your soul in DeSoc is breathed into by Collaboration.

Roadmap

Join3 MVP has completed all product design, currently in the development stage. It is expected to be available for use by 2022 Q4 in a few communities which the team members are in. —We are a group of DAO enthusiasts.

We will also finish the design of collaborator social module based on Web3 social protocol in Q4, scheduled to launch in 2023 Q1.

In 2023 Q2, A Web3 Collaborator Square will be initiated to help more DAOs and collaborators to build connections.",Valid Ethereum Address. 
7268,inTheory Research Markets by Impact Finance,0,0xC0f060632E0BfbE52E48b63dAC225de9b0f856F1,"***UPDATED WITH NEW TEAM BIOS. Come meet us!***

inTheory provides a welcome entry point for non-scientist users to speculate on and support scientific research projects through the trading of various types of tokenized research assets. These assets include generative artworks, datasets, patents, algorithms, methodologies, and more. inTheory also allows users to cast their vote for which research gets funded and earn rewards when funded projects get commercialized or licensed. This supports a more connected research ecosystem.

With the support of this grant, the team at Impact Finance plans to make significant progress towards the development and launch of our MVP platform. The platform will be released open-source.

We've prepared an explainer video to help summarize the platform and its benefits:


Features
Explore & Track Scientific Research 🧬
Browse through proposed and in-progress research campaigns, learn about their potential impacts, and cast your vote to decide what research gets funded.
Buy & Sell Scientific Digital Assets 💸
Collect and trade tokenized research assets including patents, datasets, algorithms, and science-inspired NFT artworks.
Collect Learn-to-Earn Rewards 🤑
Earn tokenized rewards for building a deeper understanding of the topics underlying on-platform research campaigns.
Purchase or License Research IP 📑
Identify entrepreneurial opportunities and build a commercial portfolio of research IP driven by community interest.
Fund Your Own Research Campaigns 💰
Leverage the power of community to fund your own research projects and build your on-chain reputation as a contributor to open-access science.
Manage Your DeSci Portfolio 📈
Leverage the power of community to fund your own research projects and build your on-chain reputation as a contributor to open-access science.

Benefits
Encourages and incentivizes the sharing of research data to break down data silos 😀
Engages and informs the non-scientist community, creating a more transparent research ecosystem 😍
Streamlines the funding and commercialization of research by creating liquid markets for research assets 😊
Creates an incentive-aligned system that fairly rewards all participants 🥳

The result is a more efficient system for funding and commercializing research:

High-level process flow for research funding through the inTheory platform

What Problems does inTheory Address?
The current process for funding, sharing, and commercializing scientific research is flawed and inefficient. Poor incentive structures make it difficult for researchers to secure funding and do not reward the open-access publishing of work, leading to the creation of rigid data silos and an opaque research ecosystem. Taxpayers are a primary funding source for science in today's system, but then have no involvement in the selection of what research gets funded and have limited transparency into progress and results.
Each year, trillions of dollars are invested in scientific research projects around the world. There exists an opportunity to expand community involvement and redesign incentives so that a wider pool of owners, investors, and benefactors are activated. By addressing these problems, we can accelerate the pace of human discovery and restore public trust in the scientific process.

Goals for GR15
-Connect back-end and smart contract logic to the current UI on EVM-compatible testnet (Mumbai and/or Alfajores)
-Perform proof-of-concept and feasibility testing of transfer of ownership workflows
-Complete demo research project flow with dummy project
-Finalize parameters in tokenomics model using Machinations.io and/or tokenSPICE

7270,dDAO community - small sociological experiment,0,0xf91aAB6F4D844Ce8CaD6620c474508f89E556aC0,"Overview

dDAO is a community focused on exploring progressive decentralized governance. We attempt to progressively build a decentralized organization from an initial 100% centralized status, using consensus-based decision-making methods.

We use Aragon to issue non-transferable reputation points for governance purposes. Starting with the initiator holding the majority of reputation points, dDAO slowly distributes points to other members as the DAO grows and records the degree of decentralization.

In our future explorations, we will document and open source the progress of our experiments, research and practical outcomes, in the form of articles, DAO tools and iteration logs.

dDAO experimental progress
The early members of dDAO spent a week designing the most basic governance rules for the community, using non-transferable points as proof of community governance rights. Within 6 weeks, we successfully reduced the concentration of community governance rights from 100% to 80.2% by incentivizing community members to participate and awarding governance points weekly.

In the experiment, we explored the distribution of collaborative task contributions. Inspired by the gift economy, we use the model of ""distribution by recognition"" to distribute the points. A discord bot has been developed by community contributors as a prototype.

We are also exploring more automated decentralized governance. We want to create a complete journey for the proposal, community collaboration, contribution allocation, mutual evaluation of collaborative outputs, and automatic awarding of governance points. The community will explore solutions for each of these modules, e.g. trialling various DAO tools, developing tools, etc. We already have a product in internal testing progress.

Besides the governance experiments, dDAO also fostered the community vibe by encouraging members to initiate 'friends’ projects’ and research. One of these projects, dToys, has applied for the Seed Club accelerator 05. Most importantly, the projects that grow from the dDAO only belong to their contributors, not dDAO. dDAO wants to focus on experimentation and provide a community for projects to emerge like sparks.

Current state

We have produced tools and product frameworks for contribution recording and community governance scenarios in the following three directions.

Community work consensus pricing.
We used dework and documents to initially establish a framework for how to rate the size of different work contributions to the community.

Identifying the proportion of contributions from collaborators: Poppy
dDAO members are developing a tool called Poppy for the mutual evaluation of contributors to create a better collaborative relationship.

Quality evaluation of the output and automatic execution: Govzero
dDAO members have developed a proposal voting tool to enable more smooth community decision-making, the function of this tool includes contract control for proposals, voting, non-transferable token issuance, and contractual control of the vault. Govzero has now completed the first round of prototype testing. We will also migrate the reputation points to Govzero in September.

Future of dDAO

dDAO hopes to continue exploring decentralized governance with experiments in the future and to continue documenting and collating the open-source experimental process. We plan to build a chain-wide decentralized governance process. We will bring the community closer together by strengthening consensus methods to keep the community active.

The dDAO vault is used to incentivize community members to export experiment reports in different vectors such as articles and videos, and to support necessary expenses such as experiment facilities and community operations including the DAO Tool.

Problem & Solution



Work



CredMix measures and rewards value creation and contribution within DAOs, which makes the individual contribution more visible as they work together in a project or community. It uses both objective and subjective measures to accurately capture and update an individual contributor’s impact on a project.

CredMix maps all participants and contributions in a graph, illustrating how contributions and participants in a project are connected to each other. Each contribution a participant makes is represented as a separate “node” in this graph.

This data is used to create a Cred Score for each node using a modified PageRank algorithm. The DAO decides which contributions will ""mint"" Cred, making them a source of new Cred.

Participants earn Cred by contributing to a project. A participant's Cred score reflects how valuable their contributions were. As an example, consider a Discourse forum post. The post is itself a contribution, and it generates Cred for its author, but it also generates Cred for any post to which it replies and/or for any posts or users that it references.

Of course, this is because only 1% of the earths water is available to us as fresh water. So how can we solve this?

Innovation happens at a rapid rate when there is an economic incentive to innovate. The ReFi DAO Water Circle aims to create that incentive through creating a desalination credit that individuals and corporations can use to offset their water usage. Desalination is currently costly, energy intensive, and leaves a leftover brine concentrate. We can create a tiered credit system that will force technologies to innovate in order to produce a more premium credit.

The ReFi DAO has begun community circles where founders can focus on specific areas they are passionate about in the space. Our group is knows as the Water Circle where we explore ways in which we can bring about positive change in water treatment and availability around the world. We believe that we have found a path where we can have a significant impact through the creation of a standardized water credit. The goal is to create a standardized water credit that a whole water credit ecosystem can be built off of. This may sound ambitious, but isn't that what we do in the blockchain world? We want to carry out this project because we believe that we can create that first step by creating a desalination credit. Carbon credits came to acceptance in the traditional space, we want ReFi to lead the charge on water credits. 

Why do we need grant funding?

In order to drive this forward we need one of two things, either a lot of research help from the community to help us get this going (which many amazing people in the space have been willing to already contribute), or we need some grant funding so that we can hire a some research help and in a best case scenario enough to run our own pilot project. 

How will you know how the funds are being managed?

We will be posting constant updates inside the ReFi DAO Water Circle tab. The goal is to be as transparent as possible with exactly how funds are being used and progress being made. You can also DM James the Water Circle lead and ecoToken founder anytime on Discord to ask questions about the progress

What actually needs to be done?

We want to follow the process of creating credits on the Regen Network. To do this we first have to finish developing our credit class and submit the official concept note.

7107,Defishy.xyz - Democratizing Blockchain Data,0,0x389E3d1c46595aF7335F8C6D3e403ce2E8a9cf8A,"Mission
Defishy.xyz is a suite of blockchain data analytics tools created to simplify and democratize access to important blockchain data. 

Gone Fishing
The initial tool that we have built is free for use by all is a dashboard to track the liquidation health of borrowers on Aave. We are also rapidly expanding our offering of this liquidation health dashboard to other protocols while also expanding our product suite.

Protecting Fish from Contagion
During the crypto collapse of May 2022, many whales had over-borrowed betting on asset prices and yields that proved to be unsustainable. As liquidators sold massive amounts of collateral on exchanges, collateral prices dropped, which resulted in more liquidations.
We created Defishy to democratize liquidation health data of all wallets, such that users are able to manage liquidation risk more effectively.

The Future of Defishy (and why we need your support!)
Because of the great initial reception for our liquidation health dashboard, we are now developing our product offering to a full DeFi analytics suite. Below are two Figma mockups of what Defishy will look like in the future:





As shown in this bottom mockup, we are also currently focusing on sourcing historical data for more historical trend analysis as well as simulation modeling. These will be very powerful additions to our product suite by allowing users to look into the past to better interpret the potential future. 

About the Team
Defishy was created by a group of four builders from Dartmouth Blockchain, the blockchain research and development collective at Dartmouth College. Defishy is free to use, and we would appreciate any feedback or suggestions, so feel free to send them in our Discord! You can also view our repo on Github.

Thank you for your support and happy fishing!

7108,"Scaling Nature Positive Credits through Digital Measurement, Reporting and Verification",0,0x4FaF9432F7Dbfe93b67057Bb6aAdDEe6684DEB08,"THE PROBLEM
Environmental markets, like carbon, are expensive, complicated and opaque. They don’t serve the needs of credit developers, buyers or end-consumers. There are questions regarding the quality of credits and a lack of understanding of carbon amongst consumers reducing the payback for brands and businesses who are investing in offsets.

THE SOLUTION
Using on-the-ground and remote sensing technology paired with spatial imaging and AI we are improving the integrity of nature-based environmental projects. Our goal is to help market participants create, trade and retire high-quality, nature-positive credits with confidence and transparency in a single click whilst increasing end-customer engagement.

PROGRESS
We are currently demonstrating customer market fit with our pilot project and first customers where we are on target to verify and sell our first Nature Positive credits in the next 2 months. 

We have developed:
A V1 methodology that rewards Nature Positive actions
A customer dashboard to share company impact with their consumers
Our first remote verification protocol
We are still developing:
An app for project management that helps reforestation organisations coordinate their project with land stewards whilst also acting as a data source for initial verification. 
Our digital ledger architecture and framework to automate the issuance of credits in a trustless and transparent fashion
Our GIS including integrations with the project management app and remote sensing (satellite) technology

7115,IOUPlay,0,0x11fEc6735eDc07270d9412cb7708776EB0b847FC,"IOUplay aims to increase trust between gamers, guilds, and GameFi NFT investors. Basing on IOUtokens, ""people's money with feedback"" - SBT (soulbounded tokens). It means  tokenized civil debts receipts, promissory notes, or convertible notes, issued by anyone, anytime, anywhere, & backed by goods & services. The community rates & acts as sureties for responsible issuers so they can qualify for financing.
The investor who bought game NFTs wants to get revenue from its renting. But they don't know who comes to rent this NFT because they see just a game account. We trying to  solve this  problem.
We offer investors a new instrument of gamer's reputation - the IOU token. At this token saved history of rents, wons (and fails) of this gamer.
After every renting period, investors can burn one gamer IOU and rate their results.
Everybody can see this rating and feedback.
While communicating with the players, we found out that the game guilds need “replenishment” in the form of active and trained players, while new players, “newbies,” face complex rules, and it is difficult for them to understand the winning strategies immediately.

We used the soul bounded token (IOUtoken) developed by us, with which the student can pay the teacher. Thus, the teacher becomes interested in teaching students. A teacher later receives students' gaming obligations either as the time of their playing or just sell them.
Since the Master spends his time fiddling with the beginner, and the beginner saves time on figuring it all out, he pays the master time with his IOUtoken obligation, and the master writes the beginner's “qualification” there as a recommendation.

We are creating a school of reputation capital to teach players how to use SB tokens. We are running a peer-to-peer program to train “newcomers” by already experienced players (“masters”) to earn money in new games and increase their attractiveness as players for investors in P2E.
Experienced players can earn extra money by teaching beginners. And beginners quickly master the intricacies of the game. For example:
1. The master recommends NFTs that make sense to buy and rent;
2. The master gives a list of winning combinations and strategies in the game;
3. The master explains the basic principles of the game through NFT combinations (or intelligent action algorithms);
4. You can zoom master and novice and share the game screen to make moves with recommendations;
5. A beginner can send logs of his “fights” to the master and receive comments about what was done wrong;
6. Under the guidance of the master, you can set up some automated options (if there are bots in the game, for example, auto-renewal of the lease, search for a profitable lease, etc.);
7. The master can help them understand the interfaces and features.


Also, based on the player’s interest, we are making an exchange (a fork of Uniswap) so that these tokens can be staked and investors, seeing the ratings and achievements of the players, can invest in players, as in a “traditional” sport.

We are making an Escrow - a smart contract “for learning” - a student and a teacher exchange obligations for learning and paying by moving them to this smart contract. Tokens move irrevocably. After a period agreed by the parties, each participant gets access to the tokens of the other.

Also, gamers can transfer their SBT IOUtokens to each other tokens contract  to make mutual surety.

Project currently deployed  on  Moonriver, Polygon, Harmony, Aurora,  Celo and several testchains. In close future - on Heco, BNB  and Fantom.

7118,Repro Grants - Fast funding for female reproductive science,0,0x755510C0c06F2E3950171d8BF99A8902c0645554,"What causes endometriosis? We don’t know.
Why do women go through menopause? We don’t know.
Why are women 2x more at risk for Alzheimer’s Disease? We don’t know.
What is the long-term impact of hormonal contraceptives? We don’t know.

’We don’t know’ isn’t good enough.

What is Repro Grants? 

Repro Grants is a “fast grants” program that awards $10K-$100K to ambitious research projects aiming to deepen our understanding of the female reproductive system. We are motivated to learn how our bodies work, so we can develop better diagnostics and interventions to improve women's health outcomes and longevity. 

Findings enabled by this program will allow all other researchers and entrepreneurs to build on top of the knowledge and further expedite the overlooked field. To enable open science, we first need science. Hence, unlocking funding for basic research is a crucial first step toward a thriving open science ecosystem that supports women’s reproductive health solutions. All manuscripts reporting work supported by the grant will be uploaded to a preprint server such as bioRxiv or arXiv or even Desci nodes upon submission. We don’t want to delay the impact of the work by long publication cycles!

It’s hard to get funding for novel and experimental research. We're making the application and review process efficient (the application form takes ~30 minutes to complete and the applicant will get a decision within 21 days) so scientists can focus on what matters the most –- doing the science.


We’re embarrassingly late.

Since the Hippocratic oath, the male body has been the “medical norm”. Only in 1993 did the NIH, the primary federal agency for supporting medical science, first mandate that clinical trials should be run on both men and women. Unfortunately, this law only applied to NIH grantees and not the pharma industry which is responsible for more than 90% of trials. This means that modern medicine is based on research almost exclusively done on male bodies, with severe implications on women’s health outcomes: 
⇨ We overmedicate women. Most drugs have a 'one-size-fits-all' dosage despite obvious sex differences e.g. body fat composition. A study found that over 96% of common drugs (like aspirin) are prescribed to women in too high doses leading to excess side effects.

⇨ We misdiagnose women. Across 700 diseases women are on average diagnosed significantly later than men. For example, a woman having a heart attack is 50% more likely to get the wrong diagnosis due to differences in symptoms and sensitivity to commonly used diagnostics.

⇨ We ignore female anatomy. It was only in 1998 that Helen O'Connell discovered that the clitoris is not just a tiny bulb at the top of the vulva but about a 10-cm long internal structure. That’s almost 30 years after humans landed on Mars! Apparently, the vulva is more inaccessible than Mars.

Although progress is evident, female-specific conditions remain secondary research subjects. Nowhere is this as clear as in the field of reproductive health. As of 2022, it takes on average 10 years to get diagnosed with endometriosis, an excruciatingly painful condition where tissue similar to the lining of the uterus (endometrium) starts to grow outside of the uterus. The cause and cure for endometriosis remain a mystery to modern medicine. 

And if you aren’t convinced yet, in the last two decades we have churned 5.5x more studies about male infertility than female infertility. Not to mention that in 2019 alone, the number of publications on male erectile dysfunction surpassed studies on female fertility by nearly 6-fold. We have centuries worth of research to catch on to properly understand how the bodies of half of the world’s population work.

Why do we need Repro Grants? 

Relatively small sums of capital are directed towards supporting fundamental research for women’s reproductive health. About 15% of all NIH funding goes to women’s health (2018 data). This capital allocation does not take into consideration or intend to correct the hundreds of years lag in women’s health research. 

Beyond the capital dilemma, the mechanisms for accessing funding are too slow. It is estimated that leading researchers spend up to 50% of their time writing grant applications. We want to offer an alternative; a fast and efficient process for getting access to crucial funding, so scientists can focus on what matters the most — doing the science. We are starting with a quick experiment; deploying $1M in Fast Grant Round 1. We will take the learnings and hope to increase the scale and velocity of the funding in future rounds.

7121,WalliD wallet,0,0xA3E108c4825dA083aFAE4704fd7977b37C5dec4a,"WalliD is the self-sovereign aggregator toolkit for all Digital IDs.
 
Users can privately manage all their digital IDs through a single wallet independently of underlying infrastructure or network. 

Webapps can connect to single SDK to authenticate and verify users’ IDs through their favourite protocols and networks.

About WalliD

WalliD was founded at the end of 2018 by Filipe Veiga and Vitor Viana with the purpose to build self-sovereign tools for non-financial assets (a.k.a Identities and certificates).

Digital IDs are taking over the internet in this decade, pushed by different agents with different goals in mind. Governments are rolling out centralized infrastructures to issue digital certificates for their citizens while the web3 industry is building an alternative reputation system, based on decentralised infrastructures and digital credentials.

None of them is going away anytime soon so our mission became to make sure that users would keep the ability to manage all of them in a private and secure way and Webapps would be able to seamlessly choose which protocols and IDs will be used to verify their users’ identities.

Where we are now

During the last couple of years we have been fully focused on building the underlying infrastructure of our toolkit that today is composed of:

📇  ID protocol SDKs - To connect centralized or decentralized ID protocols with WalliD ecosystem and make they assets accessible by users and WebApps (the government Portuguese ID issuer was the first integrating with the toolkit)

✅ Verifier SDKs - To provide WebApps an easy way to authenticate users and verify identities from any ID protocol or network connected to the ecosystem (DocuSign was the first webapp integrating with WalliD to provide ther users the ability to sign documents with ETH addresses)

👛 WalliD wallet - Self-sovereign Ehereum wallet to authenticate users on web2 or web3 apps , to locally store the keys to access ID assets from multiple protocols and to provide proofs-of-ids based on those assets.

Our roadmap of integrations ahead:

Lukso Network - We are currently participating in their hackathon to integrate WalliD wallet as the native wallet to and to provide bridge for all their assets and smart contract standards with all other EVM networks.

Proof-of-Humanity - In September we’ll be integrating the protocol to enable WalliD users to bring their PoH into the wallet and use it in combination with proofs-of ownership over other IDs.

PolygonID - In October we'll be focused on making sure our toolkit is connected to PolygonID, making our wallet compatible with their ZK protocol and making it easier for their users to connect with it without the need of a specific new PolygonID wallet and app

EBSI - We’ll submit WalliD wallet for the conformity test, ensuring a certified compatibility with W3C standard for digital credentials and the compliance for legacy and government related use cases.

Ceramic Network - Ceramic is one of the most used ID protocol in the web3 and it also relies on W3C standard for their decentralized credentials. After the EBSI conformity we'll connect our wallet to the protocol, ensuring most ID protocols and networks are covered by our toolkit and dApps or Webapps have a single SDK to integrate and customise the ID verification experience for their users.

The scope of GR15 - WalliD wallet

Even though WalliD is a toolkit with many components we’re submitting our fully open-source wallet for this round. The wallet is the core component of the toolkit and the piece that ensures:

a bridge between users, protocols and Webapps. 
all these networks to come together under a single address if the user so desires and the 
ultimate sovereignty for the users over all their digital IDs.

Try out WalliD wallet now and build your ID Portfolio here.

What will we be using the funds for?

Wallet Audit
New wallet features development
promotion of the toolkit within the communities of networks identified above
push forward the number of integrations with other relevant protocols and networks

We all know privacy has been the big issue always and web3 has been looking like the safe-haven for everyone. The only problem is, developers haven't yet really delivered the promise of web3 and blockchain powered solutions. 

We have taken upon ourselves to start filling the gaps by developing privacy conscious siblings of the Web2 products. Shorty has a few basic features;
1. URL shortener
2. Self-destructing notes
3. Scheduled private messages
4. Developer API

On the above, only number 3 does not sound so obvious, let me explain. Imagine if you could send your future self a note and at the same be 100% sure that only you can open that message. The core of Shorty is a distributed smart contracts engine that uses multi-part computation to reconstruct that message you sent your future self. Let's look at a different use, you want to write your will but do not want other to read it before some given date. The Shorty smart contracts will lock up the message and they will not be able to reconstruct the will until all conditions have been satisfied(the wallet that minted the message can adjust the conditions though). This privacy is enforced through the concept of storing messages in the smart contracts themselves, as opposed to storing them on an external service and then pulling them per need.

$SHORTS is a utility token used to pay for actions perfomed on the platform. Creating a short URL will cost $SHORTS, and so will creating self-destructing notes and scheduled messages. In addition, qouta for the developer API will also be given in $SHORTS. It necessarily is the currency of Shorty. 

We would want to use funding to secure talent that is more experienced in cryptography and secure multiparty computation that we are. Our team is location in Harare, Zimbabwe.

Imagine different blockchain public RPCs as communal pastures or grasslands. In the context of pastures/grasslands, they are susceptible to overgrazing, which can lead to a tragedy of the commons. In the case of pastures, land degradation to the point no herder and their flock can graze. In the context of RPCs, end-users overloading a public RPC service, preventing others from using it too and reducing performance for all parties, pushing them towards private, usually centralized and rent seeking, providers.
 
Overgrazing without replenishment can lead to excess emissions resulting in sell-pressure, driving down the value of the POKT token and thereby the funds the DAO receives to maintain and improve the protocol - an increasingly problematic ""free-rider"" issue. To avoid a Tragedy of the Commons, the community can augment the public RPC good and produce a Festival of the Commons - creating another source of buy-pressure and strengthening the resiliency of the Pocket Network protocol.

7135,An ENS & Web3 Project: Web3Domains.com,0,0x459EFD5F53b4Bb04b278925754Fd427783831bc5,"1. Problem: ENS & Web3 Content ""Findability""

There is a problem with the ""findability"" of ENS & Web3 content. There is not a lot of quality content available for new users entering Web3, or for existing users. This lack of quality content results in a lack of good websites or answers in search engines, like Google or DuckDuckGo. 

Everyday, new users are entering Web3, and they need to be able to find useful Web3 answers and helpful ENS content. It is critical that new users can find good data and quality content in search engines and via Web3 social media, which connects users and industry commentary, to point all users in the right direction.



2. Solution: The ""Web3Domains.com"" Project

Web3Domains.com is a project seeking grants to pay content writers and other human resources to create content and publish information for ""Web3 users, Google SEO, and social media platforms"". The goals of the project are to drive awareness by increasing desired-searchable information, driving needed visibility in Google-SEO for topics related to ""decentralized domains, Web3 domains and identity"", with a particular focus on the ENS Protocol and the ENS DAO, and driving Web3 community discussion via social media platforms.

The Web3Domains.com project plans to simplify the discovery process for users new to the ""Web3, NFT/Crypto, and Web3 Domain"" industries, by publishing timely and quality information across Web2 and Web3 social media platforms. These activities will include social-audio discussions via Twitter spaces and Clubhouse, to help raise awareness for users during their discovery process.



3. Soft launch & Strategic Assets: Success & Strength

Note: To date during our soft-launch, the Web3Domains.com project has connected with scores of independent Web3 content creators, and has published nearly two dozen articles from eight different Web3 writers and reporters. Not only has this provided several important pieces of content for new key subjects, but this has also contributed to eight new builder-creators, working independently in the Web3 and ENS industry.

The main domain, web3domains.com, is a strategic asset as it contains the exact match for one of the industry's most important SEO keywords. This will help new users find needed information more easily during their discovery-journey. Web3Domains.com will serve the ""Web3, NFT/Crypto, & Domain"" industries, with a focus on the intersection between Metaverse and NFTs with Web3 Domains, such as the ENS protocol. 



4. Project S.W.O.T.: Advantages & Challenges 

Competitors for content generation are thin for Web3 domains, specifically, so the primary competitors for the Web3Domains.com website come from the broader crypto-publications, are other content generating websites, which focus on the crypto industry in general.

Web3Domains.com has a competitive advantage over these websites in several areas.
First, Web3Domains.com has a strong focus on decentralized domains and web3 domains, while its competitors have a broader focus on the crypto industry as a whole.
Second, Web3Domains.com has a team with experience in marketing-technology, giving an edge in content creation and SEO.
Third, Web3Domains.com has premium domain name assets, which will help it to be more visible in search engine results.
Finally, Web3Domains.com has a standing in the Web3 industry, which gives it access to timely and quality information. 

Web3Domains.com may face some challenges when entering the marketplace.
First, the project is competing against well-established websites with large audiences.
Second, the project is focused on a niche market, which may make it difficult to attract a broad audience.
Third, the project is new to the industry and may not have the same level of credibility as its competitors.
However, the project plans to overcome these challenges by producing high-quality content, using SEO to improve its visibility, and building relationships with key players in the industry.



5. The Project Team: Founding Members 

The project is led by Gary Palmer Jr. (GaryPalmerJr.eth), CEO,

Consumers will be able to buy and sell tickets to their favorite concerts, sporting events, etc. with either cash or their favorite crypto's (currently Eth and ERC-20 tokens). They will receive their tickets in the form of NFT's. Blockchain tech brings with it the piece of mind that the users tickets are valid, legitimate tickets that can be traced from their initial listing on the CrypTix platform by the event organizers themselves. This aspect is not only appealing to consumers, but also to the event organizers themselves. They can see just how their tickets move throughout the platform. This gives them a clearer depiction of primary sales and in turn secondary resales. It allows transparency for all parties involved. 

The CrypTix ticketing platform will be built on the Ethereum network and governed by the CrypTix smart contract. All transactions on the platform will involve the native CrypTix token. The token will be a deflationary asset with tokenomics. 

The tokenomics of the CrypTix token are as follows:

For market transactions, a 10% fee
4% redistributed to all holders of the CrypTix token proportional to the amount of the token that they hold
2% sent to the burn address
2% sent to the CrypTix token Liquidity Pool
2% sent to the CrypTix research and development wallet
For peer-2-peer transactions, a 5% fee
2% redistributed to all holders of the CrypTix token proportional to the amount of the token that they hold
1% sent to the burn address
1% sent to the CrypTix token Liquidity Pool

The tool will enable every P2E and DeFi community out there to create transparent, engaging and lucrative giveaways for their community, using their own assets as currencies and prizes.

About The Web3 Bazaar:

Web3 Bazaar is a peer-to-peer exchange for Web3 assets supported by a non-custodial escrow smart contract that allows for swaps between any ERC-20 or NFT token between counter-parties that have already agreed to terms.
The project was born in the previous GR14 round and since then we have been serving as the go-to platform for P2P trades amongst P2E communities.

Why an open Raffle Ticket protocol?

We created a Raffle Tickets smart smart contract as a tool to engage and collab with P2E projects and promote a giveaway of their assets through the Bazaar.
 
Aavegotchi was the first community siding with us and co-launching a Raffle that is up and running on the 2nd half of August with users purchasing tickets with their native currency ($GHST) for a chance to win rare Aavegotchi NFTs.



We soon understood that we built a tool that every gaming and DeFi project out there could use so we are turning it into an open protocol in order to:

Create transparent giveaways
Eliminate the need to manually manage a giveaway
Promote transactions with their project assets
Be able to monetize an acquisition campaign

What will the W3B Raffle Ticket protocol look like?

The protocol architecture contains three blocks:

 No-code dApp to deploy the Raffle on-chain:
The interface will request the necessary data to deploy the contract: - Tickets max supply, tickets price, currencies accepted, ticket images, closing date and prizes awarded)
The dApp will trigger the Raffle Factory to deploy a new smart contract with the data submitted

Raffle Factory Smart Contract:
The Core Smart contract will process data sent by the dApp and issue a new smart contract, owned by the user, and prepared to mint new tickets for the input prize

Chain-link VRF on-chain lottery
The smart contracts will be linked to a Chainlink VRF oracle, ensuring that the raffle is processed automatically and fully on-chain, based on the ticket purchases and wallet addresses.

What will the funds be used for?
Audit the Smart contract Factory
Build the no-code interface
Deploy the Factory on multiple EVM chains

We're developing a platform for researchers to publish and fund their research, to democratize access to the powerful crypto and DeSci primitives through great and simple UX.

You have probably seen our prototype that Balaji Srinivasan shared on Twitter. We're essentially building out the vision that him and many others have laid out, where:
– Anyone can access science
– Anyone can independently verify research
– Anyone can contribute to the public good of science
– Nobody can censor it

Problem

Like most institutions, our systems for science have become ossified and are no longer aligned on progress. Many have been talking about these problems for years, but to give a quick overview:

You've probably experienced opening up a research paper and getting hit with a paywall. That's because a few for-profit companies monopolize publication and prestige, and since prestige is the currency of academia, researchers are stuck in a zero-sum competition to publish or perish.

The recent case where 16 years of Alzheimer's research was based on falsified data is largely due to these competitive dynamics. Experiment results are faked, ideas are stolen, and researchers aren't open to discussing results in the open, just because they're fighting to survive within this sclerotic system.

Solution

There are many working on trying to fix the old system, but rather than reform, we're building anew. Researchers are already decentralizing away from academia into DAOs like VitaDAO and PsyDAO, as well as new institutes like New Science and Arcadia Science.

Scholar's goal is to create a publication platform for these researchers.

A platform where they can:
– Publish on-chain
– Have immutable backups of their research
– Enable anyone to reproduce their results by linking all research artifacts
– Evolve beyond the archaic PDF format

Society as a whole would then be able to:
– Verify research, rather than just ""trusting science""
– Have open access to the public good of science
– Build on top of this open knowledge graph

Roadmap

We're still in the early stages, but this grant money would go towards building out this vision. Here's the rough idea (this is subject to change):

1. Build out the platform and smart contracts
We may use the smart contract infrastructure that DeSci Labs is building out if it suits our needs and is flexible enough.

2. Post notable research papers on-chain into a citation graph
To show that we can have composable science, just like composable finance, and to tangibly show researchers the benefits of publishing on Scholar.

3. Build the interface needed for researchers to be able to use crypto-native research tools
This includes publishing, but may include funding, ideating, collaborating, etc. as well.

4. Simultaneously backfill historical papers
So we can get an open graph of all of humanity's knowledge.",Valid Ethereum Address. 
7083,Mojo,0,0x09c0377BAdCa7349b20569f45f2D94398179Db0c,"Mojo is an audio/media streaming platform that empowers musicians, artists and content creators through web3 and blockchain technologies using IPFS.

The Mojo web3 application allows users to upload their valuable digital assets easily and seamlessly to the IPFS Network via our user interface. Files can never get deleted, hacked, edited, stolen and are never saved to a server making them truly decentralised.

IPFS is a wonderful technology as it allows for content ownership, portability, and verifiability. It powers NFT marketplaces, individual websites, file-sharing platforms, and so much more. However, IPFS, the protocol, does not have a responsibility to match the experience of traditional cloud file services. Instead, that responsibility falls onto the shoulders of the IPFS adopters.

Mojo helps fill this gap and gives musicians, artists and all content creators an opportunity to broaden their social reach by offering specially crafted audio and media NFTs that allow their followers and subscribers to access special content or unique features they provide. This can include additional videos or written content for example.

Creators can Mint NFTs and then add different attributes and values and assign these to the NFT based on the media type. Creators will be able to manage their NFT's metadata using Tableland's relational metadata protocol for EVM chains. This freedom allows creators to update non-essential data, yet keeping the true values of the NFT's in tack and aligned with core NFT standards. 

Tableland also opens up doors to cross-chain relational data for NFTs and so much more, different content could be linked from the various networks offering users even more value for their hard earned crypto.

Music platforms and streaming is not new technology. However, IPFS is still new enough that streaming is not yet native to its content delivery. And that’s exactly why Pinata is releasing streaming video through their Dedicated Gateways. 

With streaming video in place, those who visit your gateway will no longer have to wait for a video file to download fully before it can be played. Just visit the URL and the video will start streaming, just like you would expect with Netflix or Youtube, just much better. Using this NFT based content, artists can already start offering content to holders using Pinata's Submarine which will be another great feature to integrate.

Mojo aims to further it's product by building the following key features in the Mojo web3 application:

Artists should be able to upload their content in a secure and friendly manner.
Listeners/viewers should be able to view music streams on the platform free of charge
The Mojo platform should offer cryptocurrency-based payments to artists and their audiences.
Music fans should have full access to their favourite artists with bonus content and features.
Upon the purchase of a NFT, smart contracts should automatically process payments of royalty fees to digital artists and content creators.
The platform should use blockchain to keep transactions and accounting transparent.
The platform should let the artists keep most of the revenue they generate with very small fees to maintain the Mojo geek-o-system.
Listeners/viewers shouldn’t have to contend with tacky ads. The platform should consider other monetisation options, For e.g., artists can set up an agreement with their fans to share revenue if fans share music, helping it to reach a wider audience. NFT based content, artist can offer content to holders using the new Pinata Submarine feature. Establish a very high standard of niche advertising to followers
A simple user interface (UI) is important.
A Defi element should be added to our token contracts to allow staking of NFTs

Now why is this an excellent opportunity: 

- 1.5% of all transactions' is revenue for the Swapp. An annual transaction volume of $100 million would generate $1.5 million in income. 
- The Swapp is not liable for a breach, but rather the entity supplying liquidity to the exchange will be affected. We do not store and supply crypto for the exchange to function because it runs through the API a funded wallet. Incase of a breach, the API is switched to another provider. 
- Opportunity of a DAO Token for investors to produce passive income for themselves, and to serve as governance over what tokens to add or remove.

7098,INFINITRI: A new way of forest preservation and regeneration,0,0x5a640aC15E7cA26e6067B2F8dd53a7142016b596,"INFINITRI is a web3 organization based in Paramaribo, Suriname, that aims to redefine forest preservation and regeneration through the use of technology, financial tools and real world development. At the center of these developments are the communities that have lived in these forests.



Project Patamacca
Patamacca is a resort in Suriname located in the District of Marowijne, with a total area of 1,183 km2. The resort of Patamacca has historically been inhabited by maroon tribes. According to the last census held in 2020, the area was inhabited by roughly 470 people.

This resort's main economic activity came from its local palm oil industry. This industry was destroyed due to the consequences of the Surinamese civil war in the 1980’s. During the 1960’s there was also an attempt at a large forest plantation by Bruynzeel, but that project was abandoned eventually.

Besides a large granite mine operated by Grassalco, there are little to no legal and sustainable developments in that area.



The China Zhong Hen Tai Company

In an attempt to redevelop the resort of Patamacca and its palm oil industry, the government of Suriname signed a deal with the China Zhong Hen Tai (CZHT) company in 2004. In exchange for the development of a palm oil plantation and community investments for the inhabitants of the resort, CZHT was awarded a 520km2 concession and granted an ICL (incidental cutting license). This license gives the holder the ability to cut down all trees in that area, in this case for the development of the palm oil plantation.


As things stand there is no palm oil plantation and no job opportunities for the tribes of Patamacca. There is a growing group that now resorts to illegal logging and gold mining. The current sitting government of Suriname has announced it has started the process of withdrawing the license given to CZHT.

Information gathered on the company and past government dealings.

How we intend to solve the problem

We are using blockchain technology as a foundation for the products and services we intend to offer. We believe that this technology will assist in bridging the gap between preservation efforts and sustainable economic growth.

Farming as a Service

We see Farming as a Service as a great opportunity to bring investment opportunities and create jobs for the people of Patamacca. Through land fractionalization on-chain we could offer plots of land on which the various tribes of Patamacca will use for farming.

We aim to partner with several local and international farm companies, that will not only assist in the development of this project but also teach the necessary techniques that are required for in-forest farming. With the assistance of these partners, we can work towards farm products that can be exported throughout the region.

Through a user-friendly dashboard, royalties earned and other important information about the plot of land will be displayed.

Plots of land would be offered as the project and the demand for the product grows. Our goal is to gradually develop between 5 to 10km2 for the usage of the Farming as a Service model.

All funds received through GR15 will be allocated towards building our Farming as a Service model and invest in the necessary infrastructure to further help reach our goal. 

Forests preservation

The remaining land will be preserved and only used for development that directly benefits the tribes of Patamacca. If and when this project is eligible for carbon credits, we will use these funds to help further develop the amenities needed for those living  in Patamacca.

7140,EthPay | The First Decentralized Ethereum Payment Gateway and Transaction Validation Protocol,0,0x9eC285EeC188F0EbFa9f88Da4807bE5b049fc049,"What is it?
EthPay is the first and only complete anonymous and decentralized ERC-20 payment gateway.
 
Traditional De-fi payment gateways first collect funds into a centralized De-Fi wallet, and then it is up to them to withdraw the money to your wallet or not. This problem is a giant hole in every De-Fi payment gateway, and We fix this hole by decentralizing every single transaction from sender to receiver.
 
EthPay facilitates any developer, even without blockchain development knowledge, to implement De-Fi payment methods to their web applications from EthPay API. And the EthPay Link feature makes your payments to make them from a single click. This technology minimizes QR scanning and public key copy and pasting just to click and pay level. Also, this may help avoid mistakes and fraud during transaction procedures. EthPay is the next-level ERC-20 payment option.



Only ERC-20?
No, EthPay 1 - Beta is the first look of the EthPay technology, and we are on the way to expanding other ERC transactions such as ERC-721 & etc. at EthPay 2. EthPay 3 will cover the entire ecosystem by adding other Ethereum coins.
 
Decentralized
EthPay is not like a traditional payment gateway. It does not use any third-party wallets to collect and withdraw funds. EthPay transfers the transaction directly from the sender wallet to the receiver wallet in real time.
 
Anonymity
The data we store are public keys and other public information such as txHashes and block numbers to process and validate your transactions. We do not collect any personal information except the above, such as your IP addresses, Names, Emails, Passwords & etc., directly. That is our commitment to privacy and anonymity.
 
The Technology
We developed an algorithm to validate ERC-20 EthPay API transactions reliably. In this technology, we used an ABI to store pre-defined 256-bit code at the blockchain along with the transaction as input data. EthPay validation protocol checks this input with our database to verify the transaction. And we give you a secret code to validate transactions in your web application too and the secret code is secured as your wallet’s private key is secure.
 
So, for what do you grant?
We have currently released the first technical preview of EthPay 1. EthPay technology is set to expand through three stages (EthPay 1, EthPay 2 & EthPay 3).
 
EthPay 3 will be the best available payment solution for the entire Ethereum ecosystem. EthPay expands the Ethereum eco-system to the developers and users who already haven’t been involved with ERC transactions. And the main point is, that ERC is the most sustainable transaction option you can click at the checkout. And you are contributing to making EthPay 3 real!

Everyone has their own tool for note-taking. SamePage brings them together as an intra-TFT network. You use Roam while they use Obsidian, and SamePage syncs changes across your team without needing to leave your custom setup. DeSci is driven on protocols like SamePage. Give your team a way to share knowledge without barriers. 

At this stage, we have raised $48k from Filecoin Network Goods Dev Grants. We are seeking grant funding to build out the next stage of the SamePage Network. 

SamePage Stage 1 Milestone 2 Demo - Watch Video



As seen above, today we have a functional sync between Roam graphs, Logseq graphs, and Roam-to-Logseq graphs with data stored in IPFS. This gives collaborators a way to work together without needing to leave their environment or give their data to another third party. 

David and Joel’s work building the Discourse Graph RoamJS plugin laid the foundation for this project. We believe synthesizing knowledge and collaborating on discourse graphs to be the first major application for research teams to use SamePage. This project goes a step further to accelerate the creation of research public goods, particularly those suited for decentralized collaboration and science. 

Project Description

Tools for thought (TFTs) are applications that are meant to augment human intelligence by providing quick capture of ideas via notes and free association of these ideas via links and references. The space is currently littered with plenty of different web2 options, from Roam to Obsidian, Notion to Logseq. 

Each of the companies behind these products believe that their specific data model and bundle of user interfaces will be the solution to solving personal knowledge management, and some believe they could grow into the solution that solves collective knowledge management.

However, all users are different and have highly specific needs. This has played out by Notion and Roam starting as the primary two tools of choice, and slowly losing power users to the newer entrants in the space. As users continue to migrate between tools and settle into their preferred UI and servers of choice, collaborating has gotten increasingly difficult. In order for teams of researchers or independent contractors to collaborate, they either need to a) compromise into using one tool, copy/pasting data back and forth from their personal tool or b) import/export data from their personal tool to the personal tools of their colleagues.

Because of this, tools for thought on their own will not be a sufficient answer for collaborative thought. What we need instead is a protocol for thought: a set of decentralized computing resources and adapters from each of these tools. A network that allows users to continue sketching ideas in their personal tool for thought and that tool interfacing with the tools of their colleagues directly.

An example use case: I want to be able to open a page in Roam and have it connect directly with a page in another user's Obsidian vault. We can write changes to the same document asynchronously and they will be resynchronized once connected to the internet.

To achieve this, we plan to develop SamePage, a network composed of a series of stateless lambda functions that will use IPFS as the file storage backend. To help inform the design of the protocol for communicating with this network, we will implement a series of plugins for a set of the previously mentioned tools for thought. In our MVP, we are connecting:
Roam
Obsidian
Logseq
In the future, we will extend the network to also connect:
Notion
Evernote
Athens
Remnote
And more

Value 

Successfully building out this network would allow teams of people to collaborate with each other without having to all migrate to a single platform. A research lab could have one member in Roam, one in Obsidian, and one in LogSeq, and still be able to share one lab notebook of findings without any of them compromising on their tool of choice. This would provide users of these tools an alternative to the current export=>import=>reformat workflow with the ability to interface with each other directly. Since the proliferation of new tools for thought in 2019, the unserved need to connect work across different software platforms grows. 

Through Joel and Brendan's prior research, they've seen this problem repeatedly — it's hard to bring others up to speed, especially when team members use different tools. Even then, when teams don't share the same vocabulary, struggles occur to introduce new team members to a project. David has already made strides to solve this later problem, introducing a multiplayer connection within Roam that allows for different users to share pages — and their surrounding context — to enable teams to collaborate with reduced friction.

The primary user groups we are targeting are those collaborating around either a problem or set of tasks. The former often involves research groups with labs composed of members synthesizing their research on their own tools and currently struggling to find a way to combine their findings and build off of each other. The latter involves freelancers and agencies who are looking to reduce friction around onboarding new clients by allowing each party to stay in their company’s tool of choice. 

Funding for Upcoming Milestones

The funding we're seeking will pay our core contributors and allow us to expand to bring on additional team members - a community leader, content marketer, and engineers. 

We've outlined our goals at each milestone along with projected resources.

Stage 1: Initial MVP - completed in November 2022
Have a prototype that syncs changes between a Roam graph, a logseq graph, and an Obsidian vault
Looking for four months of development to sprint towards this MVP
David + Brendan will work on this alone
Funding secured: $6K * 4 months * 2 people = $48K
Stage 2: Launching teams
Source and launch research teams and freelancing agencies onto the TFT Net
Will need to do large scale marketing before hand to see interested parties
Create a Slack for managing the community.
Continually gather feedback from teams and implement
20 teams?
Possibly create a channel per team 
Would like to add a Marketer and a Community Manager to the team
Funding Requested: ($8K * 4 months * 4 people) + $12k for infrastructure budget = $140K
Stage 3: Implementing business model
Discover the ""limited resources"" areas of the protocol and begin to build a pay-per-use business model around them
Reach out to possible universities, companies, and TFTs themselves for partnership deals
Build out integrations with Stripe (web2) and Wallets (web3) giving users flexibility to how to sustain the protocol
We can’t assume a web3-only audience - we are bridging onto existing TFT apps
Would like to add a Designer (for conversion flows) and second engineer (for maintaining existing product)
Funding Requested: ($8K * 4 months * 6 people) + $18k for infrastructure budget = $210K
Stage 4: Growth
Pedal to the metal
Incorporate work as a DAO
Would like to add someone to just be in charge of documentation. Might need to add someone for legal/flex spot.
Would also like a budget for bounty work for non core contributors. Flex spot could be someone in charge of bounties from non core contributors.
Funding Requested: ($8k * 4 months * 8 people) + $30k Infrastructure budget + $64k bounty budget (64 bounties at $1k) = $350K

Team Members + Relevant Experience

David Vargas leads all engineering work on SamePage. David is the founder and maintainer of RoamJS - Roam's largest library of open source extensions. He has connections with team members at most of the tools for thought companies, and has built familiarity with the web3 space through work with Creator Cabins and Fission. He maintains constant contact with the team at Roam and has been influential in the design of their public APIs. He has been working as an independent open source software engineer for nearly two years now, after leaving a startup he worked at as an engineer the previous two years before that.

Brendan Langen leads product and operations-related work on SamePage. Brendan has more than a decade of experience leading new product development and Product Design & Development teams at startups and established, growing companies. He's worked on popular educational games, business simulations, and award-winning authoring tools. Recently, Brendan worked with Robert Haisfield and Joel Chan to publish their research on scaling knowledge synthesis. This work dove deep into tools for thought and decentralized software, as funding came from Edge & Node. Through this, deep contacts have been established in the academic research and tools for thought communities that this tool is being built for.

Joel Chan is an advisor to the SamePage project. Joel is an Assistant Professor in the University of Maryland’s College of Information Studies (iSchool) and Human-Computer Interaction Lab (HCIL). Previously, he was a Postdoctoral Research Fellow and Project Scientist in the Human-Computer Interaction Institute (HCII) at Carnegie Mellon University, and received his PhD in Cognitive Psychology at the University of Pittsburgh. His research investigates systems that support creative knowledge work, such as scientific discovery and innovative design. 

His long-term goal is to help create a future where innovation systems are characterized by openness and sustainability. His research has received funding from the National Science Foundation, the Office of Naval Research, the Institute for Museum and Library Sciences, Adobe Research, and Protocol Labs, and received Best Paper awards from the ASME Conference for Design Theory and Methodology, the Journal of Design Studies, and the ACM SIGKDD Conference on Knowledge Discovery and Data Mining (KDD). His most relevant recent and ongoing experience is the development and study of the Discourse Graph RoamJS extension, and supporting porting of these ideas to other tools like Logseq and Obsidian.

Outreach! 

We see the SamePage Network as a gateway to enable the wider DeSci community. As a protocol layer, we want to give everyone the chance to use their own tools, so no silos exist in sharing knowledge. 

We're friendly folks who always want to discuss the future of technology, so reach out if you want to make this a reality! 

Cheers,
Brendan + David",Valid Ethereum Address.

A game based on blockchain, which connects healthy lifestyle, game and crypto. It turns users’ steps into gaming rewards. It was established by a team of sports enthusiasts and professional gamers who have been looking for the best solution so that one can be physically active without turning exercise into fanatic passion. 

Eventually, GoFanz helps to make being healthy part of one’s overall lifestyle naturally, as part of the game, and earn crypto currency. The platform combines 3 most popular models on the crypto market: 
- Move-to-Earn;
- Play-to-Earn;
- Metaverse.

How it Works:
Everyday activity recorded by a mobile or wearable device is converted into the game currency. 1000 steps = 1 GOZZ. GoFanz algorithms analyse steps recorded directly by your device and check them against other data points (GPS location, speed, and consistency of movement). It should be noted that the platform features a special anti-cheating system that prevents users from earning GOZZ in unfair ways.

Users can utilize their Avatars (Favarz) in daily battles to receive rewards of governance tokens, which later can be converted into fiat on crypto exchanges. Each Favarz is therefore unique and is essentially an NFT asset. A Favarz can be improved by 2 methods: 
1) Fans can receive daily rewards (GOZZ) for walking or jogging – the token can be spent to improve some characteristics of Avatar (Speed, Strength And Stamina).
2) Fans can buy digital attributes in the form of NFT, which also boost the characteristics of Avatars. 

Upgrading Speed, Strength and Stamina boosts chances to win in Battles and get rewarded with GoFanz Tokens (GFZ). GFZ serves to:
- Level up Favarz to keep upgrading;
- Buy & sell items on marketplace;
- Withdraw funds.

GFZ is a fungible governance staking token is used to diversify users’ experience in the GoFanz ecosystem and can be used in dApps, outside the GoFanz infrastructure.

Taking all the above into account, GoFanz is set to be a potential game-changer among NFT-games and Metaverse development, impacting real lives and encouraging people to move more in a fun way. They are creating a unique model of a bridge between metaverse and the sports industry, allowing fans and athletes to communicate in the digital space.

Most of the members of Sisu want to remain anonymous with an exception of one founder who stay public for team verification. 
Billy Pham, Founder of Sisu Network : Billy has experienced engineers with a wealth of knowledge in the Bay Area. Billy has 10+ years of experience and has worked for Google and several startups
An early engineer who was with Axie from the beginning.
Cryptography researcher : He is experienced blockchain developer at Incognito, AstraProtocol. Thanh Nguyen is specialized in Confidential Transactions, Zero-Knowledge Proof.
Privacy advisor: A Phd holder & post docs on blockchain privacy, including Zero-Knowledge Proof and Zk-snark.
MBA, Founder of Token Play: he is the Former Business Manager at OpenSea, and founder of Token Play. He now works as head of community building at Sisu.
They are both knowledgeable about blockchain consensus mechanisms and have contributed to various open source projects.

Manifesto/Vision
Our Vision is to help promote the widespread adoption of privacy through cross-chain interoperability. As survey, private transaction from both cross and in-chain, Tornado cash ($3B LVT), ZCash ($2B Cap) are privacy on a single chain. Sisu is one of the first solutions that enables universal private transaction .

We believe that by enabling users to transfer assets across different blockchains, we can help increase liquidity and value for users . Also, we vision that our proposal will help reduce congestion and costs associated with traditional methods of cross-chain interaction.

Problem
Private transaction is very hard to use and mostly used by criminals, as survey of Tornado Cash 2022.

As we know, privacy adoption is very much like Bitcoin adoption in early days and it would be hard to use: users often have to use external chains like Zcash, Monero. Especially, during these transaction, no privacy is ensured, including token swaps.

Solution
Sisu would like to make it simple by creating universal private transactions . It helps users easy to use by geting private transactions without leaving their chain. Once deposited, withdraw secretly anywhere and it could work on multiple chains.

Also, by Threshold Signature Scheme and Zero Knowledge Proof , transactions could be secured while keeping the tx fee cheap and while deleting all the trace of transaction source.

Goals
If the project succeeds, it will achieve its mission of making the cross-chain interaction easier and simplify building cross-chain applications. It will also bring users and liquidity from other chains to your ecosystem.

Metrics to Goal Measurement
Metrics:
Number of users to use Sisu to swap token from any chain to Gitcoin
Transaction volume cross chain
Volume of private transaction on Gitcoin using Sisu

Success will look like:
Bring 10,000 users to Gitcoin from all other blockchains
Total transaction volumes cross $25M
Total private transaction volume cross $5M

Progress



We have completed the Testnet Phase 1 with tokens swap on 5 different chains with test tokens. Next, we will launch Sisu on 10-15 chains with limited real token swaps. And, we will add private transaction for Sisu.

Differentiation
Competitors of Sisu are Thor Chain and ZCash:
Thor Chain: With estimated $1-3B market cap, Thor Chain only works on multiple chains only.
ZCash: With estimated $1-3B market cap, ZCash only supports privacy.

However, with the target $3-5B in 3 years , Sisu Network is the only project that offers a secure multiple-chain transaction with threshold signature and universal private transaction (including NEAR, BTC, Cardano, etc).
This makes it stand out from the competition as it offers more security and privacy .

Grant Request $
Preseed: $35K-$50K each stage
Looking to raise $600K for 3% max token supply in the Seed

What the Funds Are For
The project will be maintained through the efforts of the development team hired with the grant funds. The team will continue to work on the project after completion of the grant to ensure that it remains operational and useful.

7188,Ontologic: A Research Exchange Platform,0,0xf6420F34F17aCA711e66b6D3ae54a45DcC517540,"Overview
We are on a mission to revolutionize collaboration in science. The life sciences are existentially necessary and rapidly growing, but many labs struggle to build on existing work due to the incompatibility of their computational tooling. Ontologic is building a platform for researchers to easily share code and data, making their research output reusable, not just available.

The problem: a crisis in data and code management in science
Over half of high-impact cancer lab studies cannot be replicated, and less than a quarter of published work is reproducible by drug companies. These issues arise in part from the challenges of collaborating while using incompatible analysis tools and data structures. Platform development infrastructure is usually unrelated to the core of a research lab's business, so life science companies that build software in-house often end up with code that is hard to reuse and data that is hard to replicate. This lack of usability is not only costly to the
company, but is also harmful to the transparency and rigor of the research itself. 

Our solution: modern tooling for modern science
Ontologic's platform helps code writers and data collectors collaborate seamlessly on the cloud or compute cluster. It automates the process of packaging code into easily reusable analysis modules. The outputs are linked to machine-readable metadata structures, ready to share between users or publish on repositories. Using Ontologic's platform, users can compose analysis modules into custom pipelines and track the provenance of their inputs and outputs in a standard system. By abstracting away the particulars of data formats and programming languages, researchers can focus on the science, not the setup, of their data analysis.

Team and Progress
Our founding team consists of 3 MIT-trained PhDs with expertise in molecular, systems, and computational neuroscience and an ex-Google software engineer with expertise in distributed computing. We are serving graduate students as pilot users with a prototype product. Three lab leaders at MIT and other institutions have signed letters of intent to engage with us on a per-seat subscription model in 2023. We plan to build our platform in the highly interdisciplinary field of neuroscience and anticipate that our solution will provide value to clinical researchers, biotech, and pharmaceutical companies, our planned follow-on markets.",Valid Ethereum Address.

I have consistently hosted the space for 10 weeks. The space initially started as a popup space for fun, but the community demanded I continue to host every friday. Therefore, I broken down to the demand and commitment myself to provide the community what they asked for. 

The community was young at this time, only attracting about 15 people. Currently, the ENS FNHH now boasts attendance between 100-200 on average. Some may ask, “What does the space solve for?”. I answer that with, “It is a place where likeminded individual come together to reward themselves for the hard work put in each day to drive growth in the ENS community.” 

This space has brought people together from all over the world, where boundaries are nonexistent. We work so hard teaching, educating, and onboarding people everyday of the week. The ENS FNHH is where people can be themselves, kickback and relax. Everyone brings a drink of their choice and we escape to ENS Island where only good vibes exist around our Virtual Bar. 

If you are in spaces as much as I am, you will understand the true need to mentally unwind. So many look forward to these two hours every friday when they don’t have to be so smart 😂. 

I truly with the proper support, I can really enhance the community’s virtual experience by doing giveaways. We have incorporated a Free giveaway for all new people who join the happy hour. Each person receives a Lifetime ENS HAPPY HOUR TICKET NFT. This provides everyone access to any future irl and virtual events held by the ENS FRIDAY NIGHT HAPPY HOUR.

PampasCat specilizes in treasury management service for DAOs.For large-scale DAOs, treasuary management can be a tricky and tedious problem that consumes manager's too much time with unsatisfying outcome in return.

PampasCat aims to meet the challenge and provide treasury management service for DAOs in need.

Four primary areas

Spending: Reward core contributors, attract the right set of new contributors, and allocate budget among working groups.

Asset allocation: Ensure that the treasury can continue to fund critical development irrespective of the market environment (treasuries are mostly composed of a protocol’s native token and, therefore, they are not very well diversified).

Borrowing: Set up a borrowing strategy (fixed rate secured loans, bond issuance, protocol-to-protocol lines of credit, etc.) in order to ​​fund development and operations, fund protocol acquisitions, or fund yield farming with debt rather than tokens.

Reporting: Produce financial statements & disclosures (income statement, balance sheet, key revenue drivers, operating expenses, and salaries). If users need to spend several hours digging through Etherscan, Discourse forums, and voting tools to get a summary of the treasury’s activities, there isn’t full transparency.

Conclusion

In order to thrive in the crypto world, DAOs are adapting themselves to the dynanmic circumstances in every aspect.

7195,Solarpunk your street: fund the development of a Citizen Garden kit to reclaim the public space,0,0x3994df9F08C9C5C3fAF8386A6Dbe0dfCA04D110B,"TLDR
Help us fund the development of an open source version of the Citizen Garden (featured in The Guardian) to reclaim the public space and create new commons in every street.

Why does it matter?
In the face of the climate emergency, community is immunity. We urgently need to reconnect with nature and with one another, in every street. Regens, unite.

A Citizen Garden is an invitation to take care of nature together and create new relationships in your street. It’s about bringing the solarpunk future closer to the present. 

The Story
It all started in February 2020, 2 weeks before the first lockdown. We moved to a place in Brussels that has a garage, but we don’t have a car. Since nobody could park in front of it, we decided to turn this dead space into a community garden. We picked up some planks at the hardware store, put in some soil, and invited neighbors to plant what they wanted.



While the city turned to a standstill with the COVID, it was beautiful to see nature continue to grow. Kids of the streets came to water it and take care of it. It started new conversations, new connections.


Sadly, the city didn’t like it as much. They sent the police to ask us to remove it but we refused. On June 17th, we woke up and the garden was gone. We put posters in the neighborhood: nature missing. 


We finally found it back: it was the city that took it away and put it in the waste disposal facility among broken washing machines.



A few days later, dozens of neighbors came to support the garden. They brought new plants and flowers. A new Citizen Garden re-emerged


On July 8th, a team of super trained and courageous neighbors came to free the Citizen Garden in a special operation.


The Citizen Garden is still standing strong in front of our house and has been recently featured in The Guardian along with many other similar initiatives in the UK (showing the potential for turning this into an international movement, rooted locally but globally connected)


The plan
We want to create open source blueprints that anyone can copy, adapt and improve upon to create different citizen gardens.

To improve on the first design, we will add a place for a tool library and book library, to facilitate sharing in the street. We will also include a communication board to share announcements (things we learned building the Citizen Bike Garden).

We will build one to replace the existing Citizen Garden and organize workshops to invite citizens to build others. We will also make videos to walk people through the steps.

My proposal is to hand-embroider a colourful, psychedelic tapestry, inspired by the recent announcement of The Eye – a magical artefact containing Loot stories, lore and legends. This second panel of The Loot tapestry will be a shamanic vision scene, inspired by the recent announcement of The Eye – a magical artefact containing Loot stories, lore and legends. I intend to embroider a mysterious, dream-like sequence depicting visions and legends being visualised through The Eye by a shaman, using neon and brite shades of wool and drawing inspiration from the brilliant Loot stories of the OpenQuill project!

Introduction:
I am a textile and fibre artist who is currently creating stories for the OpenQuill Project, and hand-sewing The Loot tapestry. I specialise in historical recreations and restorations of Aztec artworks and codexes, in particular the Codex Borgia and the Codex Laud.

 About:
Not familiar with the Lootverse?
The Lootverse is an ecosystem of interconnected sci-fantasy stories, games, art & multimedia. Learn more here!

The Proposal:
My proposal is to create a second embroidered panel for The Loot Tapestry. This sequence would depict The Eye being used by a shaman to visualise scenes from Loot lore and legend, as outlined in stories from the Openquill programme.

For this dream-like, psychedelic vision sequence I intend to use black calico, and brightly coloured and neon-tone wools outside of the standard “Codex Borgia” colour palette. For this piece if enough funding is received I will source my wool ethically from organically kept British sheep, and will pay a craftswoman to traditionally hand-dye the wool for me according to my needs and colour specifications. 

Interest and publicity for Loot will be generated through regular work in progress posts on social media. The final physical piece could be sold or auctioned, with the majority of profits going back into the Loot DAO to help fund future artistic works and projects.

One of the principle inspirations for this project is the Bayeux tapestry, an 11th century embroidered tapestry that tells the sequential story of the Norman conquest of England.

The art style is strongly inspired by the Aztec Codex Borgia, and in particular I will be relying on hallucinogenic vision sequences from the codexes to guide my artwork style. Some examples of my Codex restoration artworks using neon and bright colours are below:


Pricing:
$300 (minimum required): A small (approx. 20x20cm) embroidery of The Eye (1 month completion time)
$500+: A medium (approx. 30x30cm) bordered embroidery of The Eye (1.5 month completion time)
$1500+: A medium (approx. 30x30cm) bordered embroidery of a shamanic vision sequence (3 months completion time)
$3500+: A large (approx. 50x50cm) bordered embroidery of a shamanic vision sequence, using hand-dyed ethically sourced wool (5 month completion time)
$5500+: A large (approx 100x50cm) bordered embroidery of a shamanic vision sequence, using hand-dyed ethically sourced wool (8 month completion time)
$8000 ( Maximum amount required): A larger and more complex bordered scene depicting a shamanic vision sequence, using hand-dyed ethically sourced wool and depicting a number of characters and visions (10 month completion time). Approx size 150x100cm

Anyone who owns the 6c-Index token, owns a fractionalized interest in the underlying carbon credit which is held under the custody of 6c-Index. The value of the Index token, therefore, also tracks with the real-time market price of the % of the allocated underlying’s value.

Fractionalized ownership of the underlying carbon credits removes the utility that allows for offsetting specific emissions. The assets are transformed into units of drawdown (UOD). They represent actual metric tonnes of carbon removed from the atmosphere and stored indefinitely.

7142,Genesis Scrolls Audiobook,0,0xB1b3751834646fb999EDd18CA62C69663071cF43,"A professionally produced and recorded audiobook version of the Genesis Scrolls stories using trained actors.



I am one of the writers of the Genesis Scrolls and I have a background in audio drama production. I have the facilities and the contacts to produce a full recording of the Genesis Scrolls book.

I have produced the audio drama The Saga of the European King and the flash-fiction podcast 100 Words of Astounding Beauty. The recordings of the stories will be released regularly as a podcast. They will drop once every two weeks, promoting Loot as a shared universe and the Genesis Scrolls project as a collaborative writing exercise. 

Music from the Minstrels and Bard of the Hyperverse projects will be used for introductions so the podcast will serve as a way to promote and distribute the music of the Lootverse as well as its fiction.

An audio book version of the Genesis Scrolls will not only be delightful in itself, but will make the Loot fiction it tells more accessible to a wider audience, including those with sensory loss or dyslexia.

We will also be able to tie the audio versions to the stories contained within the Eye (for Adventurers), strengthening the case for on-chain storytelling and paving the way for others to include high quality audio readings of the stories across the Librarium.

I have received quotes from voice actors and a recording studio in my area and can break down the total costs as follows:

Actors cost £250 for one day of recording, totalling eight hours.
There will be ~50 stories in the final Genesis Scrolls books.
The actors estimate they could record 4 stories each day, so will need to be hired for 12.5 days.
Actor costs = £3150 / $3720

The studio hire costs £20 an hour.Eight hours for those 12.5 days would be 100 hours.
Studio costs = £2000 / $2362

Mastering and production is quoted as £30 per track / story
Production costs = £1500 / $1772

Hosting will be done on Buzzsprout, for $12 / month for 12 months.
Hosting costs = $144

So total costs amount to: £6797 / $8028

If we undershoot the target funding in this round, we will produce as many episodes as the funding will allow. The minimum cost to produce a mini-series would be that of hosting, one day of recording and the production of 4 stories.
 This would be $674.

If we overshoot the target funding we will commission original music for the show, and mint the show as NFTs on a blockchain suitable for audio projects.

Note: Donations for this grant are for development only. Do not expect anything in return.



What makes Fibrous different and why to use it? 

Although StarkNet is in the Alpha process, we believe StarkNet has great potential in the future. We anticipate that many AMM protocols will be announced on StarkNet over time, as StarkNet is a validity Rollup that ensures Ethereum security and also allows very cheap transaction fees. 

This is great but comes with a few problems. Many AMM protocols have been announced on StarkNet and due to the distribution of liquidity to many AMMs, it is a bad user experience for the end user to find the one that gives the most liquidity and the best ratio among these AMM protocols. 

This is where Fibrous comes into play. Instead of navigating the AMM that gives the best rate one by one manually, Fibrous allows users to swap the best rate with one click in the cheapest way without giving any extra effort.

PARPA (Private ARPA) is a new nonprofit research organization that runs coordinated programs to push forward speculative that are too researchy to be a startup but too broad, systems-focused, or engineering-heaving for a single academic lab. 

Our main focus is on new materials and manufacturing paradigms, both because they tend to need the sort of programs we run and also because they underpin so much of human flourishing. 

In addition to our object-level output, we hope to create an organization that can create compounding knowledge about how to do powerful systems research and pave the way for other new research organizations to carve out their own niches as well.  

To give you as sense of what your money will be used for and the scale that makes a difference, PARPA programs go through three “phases”:
1. An initial ~6-12 month program design phase that takes ~$200k to pay for program manager salary, travel, and discipline-spanning technical workshops
2. A number of parallel 12-18 month proof-of-principle projects that prove out key components of the technology and suggest which of several paths are most promising. In total, these projects require ~$1.5m.
3. The full program, which runs another ~$8m. 

We currently have two active programs in the design phase and are looking to start several others.

These numbers are obviously much larger than a normal Gitcoin grant, but every bit helps!

We focus on supporting projects in longevity, nanotechnology, brain-computer interfaces, private computing, and space tech that are too ambitious for legacy funders to support.

Many of these areas could benefit from additional support but for funding and talent it can be hard to find out how to help. To onboard new talent and funders into an area, we’re building technology trees to map the domain and opportunities to support.
In addition to mapping existing projects that need support, our tech tree architects interview domain experts on open challenges in their field. We place bounties on solving them and open them up to submissions from the Gitcoin community.  
We placed 15+ bounties at 0.15 ETH each thus far to make progress on different tech trees. 
Here are the tech trees with example bounties
Neurotech & BCI Tree
Bounty: Translation of neuromarkers from lab to mobile devices

Molecular Nanotechnology Tech Tree
Bounty: Making non-silicon based nanomaterials to revolutionize the chip industry

Cryptocommerce Tech Tree
Bounty: Improving private Smart Contracts

Space Tech Tree
Bounty Get information on composition of asteroids

Longevity Tech Tree
Bounty: Measuring autophagy in the body


Currently, we collected 200+ additional problems that domain experts would like to see solved in their fields. 

Help us fund more bounties to crowdsource solutions!

Long-term, we would like to decentralize the back-end of the technology trees to live on web3 tooling and allow anyone to fork the trees to build their own, and fund additional bounties on areas they want to see solved.

Any potential funding left over from the bounties will go toward this effort.",Valid Ethereum Address.

As DAOs receive more widespread public awareness and more focused regulatory attention, leaders in this space need to be well positioned to express the needs of the industry, and address concerns of relevant regulators.

In light of this imminent need, leaders from DAOs and other web3-friendly organizations have begun to regularly convene, with the primary intention of establishing a coordinational network to advocate for the DAO ecosystem.

Our current phase of development consists of expanding membership and laying the organizational groundwork for future initiatives. These initiatives may be directly political in nature, such as our plan to establish an advocacy group to engage in direct and/or grassroots lobbying; they may be cultural, such as leading public discussion panels about important topics facing DAOs; or they may be industrial, helping coordinate projects between coalition members.

Because DAOs span a wide array of sectors and applications, the coalition itself may end up taking an ultimately decentralized organizational structure - perhaps even becoming a DAO itself, or a metaDAO. In this sense, the aforementioned coordinational network may function as a matrix to birth DAO-led initiatives pertaining to a given sector.

Hypotheticals aside, any prospects of donation implore the question of what the DAO Coalition will be doing with proceeds. Right now, the first order of expense would be start-up costs associated with establishing a US-based advocacy group. 

However, if instead of donating to the DAO Coalition wallet, you wish to split your donation between a number of our constituent DAOs and organizations, here is a collection of grants belonging to members of the DAO Coalition.

        Olandbox's project vision is to be a super aggregator that gathers all scattered information and services through the semantic web, and builds a semantic metaverse in the form of virtual land. Using virtual land nft as a carrier, information and knowledge can be displayed on the land, so as to solve the current shortcomings of artificial intelligence.
       The development of super aggregators will have several processes. At present, in view of the complexity of social media information, corporate information with the problems of information security, people and even personal information cannot be well displayed on limited social personal pages, as well as information security and other issues, especially for many projects of web3, there is a lot of timely updated information that needs to be updated. Users know, but due to the lack of a good presentation form, for us, olandbox figured out whether we can do a link aggregation, and gradually complete the goal of the super aggregator by implementing one aggregation by one.


What it does  
    The name of the information aggragation Blue Soul. Olandbox Blue Soul is a functional development based on the original land mint of olandbox. 
    As a linktree in the web3 world, it currently has the functions of personal information integration and link aggregation, and will open more functional modules in the future. According to the basic division of land, the corresponding areas will be divided into public space, official space, and private space. 
    Currently, Blue Soul will first be deployed in the official space.The main function division of Blue Soul will be divided into official space editing content, links, combined with land use to form a map.

    Olandbox Blue Soul Link: https://mint.oland.info/olandbox.v

    There are several founctions of Blue Soul:
  In addition to solving the problem of link aggregation, the function of information aggregation has been added; 
  Support users to add QR codes, personal display pictures, texts, etc., emphasizing user attributes, and meeting various usage scenarios;
  Use the wallet to log in, which has the function of decentralization and solves the hidden danger of easy leakage of personal information;
 Blue Soul supports that the domain name customization, personal information sharing page can be connected with olandbox semantic land, which can fully meet the user's usage scenarios;
  Multi-language settings can meet the needs of friends from all over the world, if a project has official accounts in multiple languages, they just need to use one link of Blue Soul which can add different languages in is enough.



   6.For the project sides, they can also get Blue Soul vertification by contacting to olandbox, so their links will have the logo and the domain name of their sharing link will be different. Also, projects who have olandbox Blue Vertification can get the authority of zero-knowledge access, which means that the users can use the 'project name'+'attribute' to search the information of the project. 
      For example, if you want to search for olandbox dc, you just need to type the infor on your chorm: https://mint.oland.info/olandbox.dc.en 
   
     That's the basic founction of Blue Soul now. At the same time, the link will also show the users' semantic land on olandbox. If people click the link, they can firsly check the link, picture and text on their profie, and later they can click the land information to see more about the land owners. And the owners can add the all the content into his private space.




     
 Accomplishments that we're proud of
    We have acomplished two bata test already. And people can mint land now, at the same time, there are over 2000+ senmantic lands minted, which shows the supports and approvel.
    Also, olandbox has started business on Opensea.
    Besides, there are over 50 projects and 200 kols in our community. And the projects side are our collabration partners who got Blue Vertification, which also means they are using Blue Soul link to present the information of their projects.

 What's next for Olandbox 
 Firstly, we will acomplish the functions of Blue Soul. The function of link  aggragation,  multi-language, supprting the users to add picture and text.
 We will add the these fouction in the near furure:
 In the future, the time setting will be supported, so that the project party can clearly mark the event time, and users can also set reminders according to the corresponding reminder time to generate an exclusive calendar;
 For users, subscription notifications will be added in the future, including project credit changes, content changes, etc., and corresponding time reminders can be added;
In the future, support the chain, as a protocol, bind the use of other dapps;
 Besides, we will also develop a new application into olandbox called Meta ID card, which can be the authentication of individuals on web3. 

Rationale:
 Olandbox is trying to be a super aggregator in web3, which is updated version of wiki. Since inception, it has been widely enjoyed by the community and has seen strong engagement. We believe that Blue Soul and another applications of olandbox will benefit the community at large. 
 And now, we are trying to create the functions of wallet bounding and zero-knowledge access, which will make a big progress of our community. We also believe it can help to build a better environment in Web3.

This is our first Gitcoin Grants round. Since starting development in May, we've:
Implemented a Flight Emission Offsetting Dapp and benchmarked its results.
Implemented an API that provides flight emission estimates.
Driven a community proposal to make Devcon VI climate neutral (Devcon is the largest Ethereum developer conference).
Implemented the tooling that will allow Devcon VI attendees to contribute to making the event carbon neutral.

disCarbon's aims are: 
To raise awareness about the impact our actions have on our planet.
To accelerate the adoption of on-chain carbon credits.
To drive the irrevocable retirement of carbon credits. 
To contribute to other public goods projects.

In order to achieve these goals, disCarbon's initial focus is carbon footprint tools that show people how they can reduce their impact on the planet and minimize their contribution to climate change. Our tools allow people to offset the emissions due to their actions using tokenized carbon credits directly on-chain. 

Our tools demonstrate how easy it is to use and retire on-chain carbon credits in order to drive the adoption of tokenized carbon among crypto-natives and provide a showcase for a legitimate and tangible use case of blockchain for those less familiar with the technology, both within the traditional carbon credit industry, and beyond.

Our future plans are:
Run a workshop on Event Emission Estimation at the ReFI Community Hub at Devcon VI.
To add more features to the Fight Offsetter Dapp such as POAP incentivization and choice of carbon offset project.
Develop a tool to easily calculate and offset event emissions.
Design tokens that drive the retirement of on-chain carbon credits.

We love Signal and ENS. Unfortunately, current Signal users have no way to utilize their favorite ENS name within Signal, and are forced to resort to traditional phone numbers. We decided to change that by building a desktop version of Signal that supports ENS name lookups, so you can search and message a user with only their ENS name!

Enabling your ENS to be found on Signal + ENS is incredibly easy, and only requires adding your current Signal number as a new text record so other users can lookup and message you knowing just your ENS name. 

We understand certain users won’t want to add their current phone number as a new text record with their ENS, which is why our team is actively developing a solution to remove this dependency to be inclusive to everyone!

This desktop app is 100% Signal, with the added ability to lookup and message an ENS name, meaning it fully interoperates with all existing Signal contacts.

Planetary health is an interdisciplinary field, recognising human health as interconnected and interdependent with ecology and the climate - it’s a field that bridges from the micro to the systemic, and is rapidly overtaking global health as the way we think about human health, wellbeing and flourishing, especially in the context of climate change.
 
As you know, blockchain can offer tools that support managing complexity and the challenges within planetary health - yet - it's still not been mobilised to its full potential.
 
We're putting on: 

*A virtual learning journey in September and October 2022 with 'experts-in-conversation' bridging planetary health and Web3, across 5 sessions, including governance, community and translocalism, and financing 

*A 3-day in person event at the Château du Feÿ in France, for experts from across the worlds of global health, climate, governance, technology, philanthropy, ReFi, DeSci, decentralisation, law, art, ecology, academia, and communities on the frontlines, interested in how blockchain technology can be used to improve planetary health and begin to cross-pollinate. 

*A lasting community for the betterment of people and planet!

This work is urgent and necessary in light of the planetary crises we're facing.
